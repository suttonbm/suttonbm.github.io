Ingredients

1kg table sugar
200ml water
5ml dry malt extract (we need some nitrogen to help drive maillard reactions a tsp is fine)
  - Replace this with F-O?
20ml slaked lime (aka pickling lime aka calcium hydroxide)
~60ml additional water
Directions

Add your sugar, malt extract and 200ml water to your slow cooker, stir to make sure all of the sugar is wet. Turn the slow cooker on to high setting, put the lid on. If you’re able to weight the lid to help prevent any build up of steam from escaping do so.
Combine the slaked lime with the 60ml water in a glass and stir it up and then set it aside to allow it to settle.
Go away for an hour or so
Return and stir the sugar sludge in the crock pot it probably won’t be fully dissolved quite yet. Put the lid back on and leave for another hour or so.
Return to see that the sugar has fully dissolved. At this point our simple heating should have produced some inversion of the table sugar, enough to help with the maillard reactions we’re about to help initiate.
Decant the clear liquid that has separated from the lime in the glass, I use a sort of flat ladle spoon to do this. Also be careful as this liquid is incredibly basic and will burn your skin.
Add the decanted liquid to your slow cooker to increase the pH
Stir your sugar syrup up and replace the lid and weight
Go away for a few hours
When you come back the room will smell like baking cookies, check on the color, and see where it is ate
