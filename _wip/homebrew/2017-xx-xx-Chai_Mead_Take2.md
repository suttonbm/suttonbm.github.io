Original recipe here.  We'll see if it is any good in a year :).

Batch Size: 1 Gallon
Target OG: 1.144
Target FG (Post-Ferment): 1.010
Yeast: DV-10

#### Ingredients:
4.1lb Clover Honey
1.0g Fermaid-O
20ml Pickling Lime
60ml Water
2c. Water
1/4tsp KHCO3
6.25g Go-Ferm
125mL Water

#### Prep:
Start with 4.1lb Clover Honey.  Pour into crockpot along with 1.0g Fermaid-O and turn on high heat.  After one hour, thoroughly mix 20mL pickling lime into 60mL water.  Decant clear liquid off and add to crockpot.  Stir thoroughly.  Cover and allow to sit for a few hours.  Goal is to have honey which is dark red/brown in color - not quite black.  Once done, add 2 cups of water and stir to dissolve.  Liquid should now be pourable.  Wait for liquid to cool and pour into fermenter.  Add KHCO3 and top up (less rehydration water).

In the meantime, prepare rehydration water.  Heat 125mL until hot, then dissolve Go-Ferm.  Once temp is 104F, add yeast and stir.  Wait 15 minutes and start adding 60mL must every five minutes.  Pitch when within 10F of must temp.

#### Fermentation:
Target pitching temp 25-30C.  After pitch, cool must to 15C.  Allow to raise 1C per day, for 15 days.  Finish at 30C to encourage complete fermentation.  SNA additions per below.  Must should be aerated twice per day for the first week (lazy way).  No Starsan in the airlock for the first 7 days.

**SNA Schedule:**
Easy.  1g F-O each day for the first four days after lag period.

#### Secondary:
Once fermentation is complete, rack onto 12oz Chai Tea Extract (below).  Allow to bulk age for 6 months, then taste and backsweeten as needed.

#### Chai Tea Extract:
6 Green Cardamom Pods, Cracked
2.5 Cinnamon Sticks
4 White Peppercorns
5 Cloves
2 Tbsp Dried Ginger Slices
1 Star Anise
1 Allspice Berry
2 tsp Assam Tea
8 oz. Vodka

Steep spices and tea in the vodka for 2-3 weeks, until it punches you in the face when you open the jar.  Strain out the spices and dilute with 4oz water.
