  Joe's Quick Pyment
---

Another "classic" mead recipe on [GotMead](http://www.gotmead.com/forum/showthread.php/8321-Quick-Grape-Mead-(drinkable-in-5-weeks)/).

#### The Ingredients
	* 2 lb [Kirkland Honey](http://imgur.com/iHLXwMH)
	* 64oz Welch's Red Grape Juice (no preservatives)
	* Lalvin EC-1118

#### The Process
Pretty straightforward.  Poured in honey and grape juice, topped up with clean water and pitched yeast.  I did add some nutrients, but didn't write down the quantities.  Turns out this may not have been necessary (or could have been reduced) due to nitrogen already in the grape juice.

Kept at ~65F for the first week, then let rise to ~74F until done fermenting.  Racked onto 1 campden tablet after ~3 weeks, added K-Sorbate after a day of activation (to avoid gerianols).  Racked again onto 6oz Kirkland honey to backsweeten.

#### Tasting Notes
Forthcoming!
