  Ancient Orange Mead, BOMM Style
---

Another flavor of [BOMM](https://denardbrewing.com/blog/post/mead-making-practices-mistakes/), thanks to Mr. Denard.

#### The Ingredients
	* 3.5 lb [Kirkland Honey](http://imgur.com/iHLXwMH)
	* Zest + Juice of one orange (Navel)
	* 25 Raisins
	* 1/2c Currants
	* 1 Clove
	* 1/2 Cinnamon Stick
	* 1 Allspice Berry
	* ~1/4 Nutmeg (Fresh Ground)
	* 1 Vanilla Bean (Whole)
	* Wyeast 1388

#### The Process
No-heat method.  Measured out honey into fermenter.  Boiled the orange juice, zest, and spices for ~10 minutes before adding to honey.  Topped up with water and shook to mix/aerate.  Pitched yeast.

Kept it pretty cool ~65F for the first week or so, then let rise up to ~74F until fermentation complete.  Racked after about three weeks in fermenter.  Added gelatin to try and clear (wasn't really successful).

#### Tasting Notes
Forthcoming!
