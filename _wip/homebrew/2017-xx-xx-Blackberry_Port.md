This recipe comes from Jack Keller, [here](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/blackbr2.asp)

#### Ingredients
6lb Blackberries (Frozen & Thawed)
1.75lb Sugar
1/2t Pectic Enzyme
2.5lb Ripe Banans
Lalvin VR21

#### Process (Plan)
Slice banans into thin disks, leaving the skin on.  Add slices to a nylon bag and place in 2.5 qt water.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes.  Skim off any crud that accumulates on the top.  Remove the bag with pulp and set into a collander to drain.  Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in the water in the pot.  Afterwards, add back any liquid that drained out of the bag.  Pour the banana water over top of the berries, add one campden tablet, and set aside for 12 hours.  Add pectic enzyme and allow to sit an additional 24-26 hours. Top up to 1.25 gallons and pitch yeast rehydrated in go-ferm.  Aerate 1-2 times per day for the first four days, and squeeze the fruit bag when adding nutrients.  After four days, remove and squeeze fruit pulp, then transfer to a secondary vessel.  Allow to sit for ~3 months before tasting.  If needed, stabilize and backsweeten with red grape concentrate.
