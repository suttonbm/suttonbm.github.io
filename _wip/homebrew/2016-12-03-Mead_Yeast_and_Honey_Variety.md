  Trying an apples-to-apples comparison of honey varieties and yeast selection

2.5lb Honey (didn't measure SG, but target ~1.1)
Aerating once/day

Planned SNA:
Nutrient Schedule (Abbaye)
Target PPM/Addition = 68
24h - 0.63g F-K + 0.97g DAP
48h - 0.63g F-K + 0.97g DAP
72h - 0.63g F-K + 0.97g DAP
96h - 1.70g F-O

Nutrient Schedule (K1V)
Target PPM/Addition = 46
24h - 0.5g F-O + 0.5g DAP
48h - 0.95g F-K + 0.38g DAP
72h - 0.95g F-K + 0.38g DAP
96h - 1.24g F-O



Amended SNA:
Nutrient Schedule (Abbaye)
24h - 0.63g F-O + 1.5g F-K (Done)
72h - 1.9g DAP (Done)
96h - 0.63g F-K + 0.97g DAP (Done)

Nutrient Schedule (K1V)
Target PPM/Addition = 46
24h - 0.5g F-O + 1.0g F-K (Done)
48h - 0.95g F-K + 0.38g DAP (Done)
72h - 0.9g DAP (Done)
96h - 1.24g F-O (Done)



K1V: Lag time ~8hr
Lallemand Abbaye: Lag time ~??
  Waited 36 hours with almost no signs of fermentation.  Panicked and pitched 1/2 packet of CBC-1 directly into the fermenter.  Turns out sometimes it takes up to 72 hours, so probably should have waited.  Oh well!
  Delayed second SNA addition by 24 hr to allow yeast to activate (added first SNA per normal schedule - 24h after pitch)

I had to adjust the first SNA addition, need to re-calculate to be sure I don't put too much in!

Missed the final SNA on the Abbaye batch.  I'll have to try the Abbaye again sometime to compare, since I pretty royally messed this one up.

12/19 - Racked to secondary, added 2x French Medium, 2x American Medium, 1/2 Vanilla Bean to each.
