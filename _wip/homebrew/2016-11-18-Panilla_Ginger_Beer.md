  Second attempt at alcoholic ginger beer
---

After my [first attempt at alcoholic ginger beer]({{ base.url }}/2016/09/alcoholic_ginger_beer/), I decided to give it another shot.  I'm planning to change a few things with this recipe to reduce the sour notes and hopefully improve the overall flavor.  First, instead of using white/brown sugar, I'm going to use 100% [panela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panela) (or piloncillo), essentially unrefined cane juice.  The draw for me here is a nice molasses-like flavor.  My hope is that combined with the ginger, this will yield a drink similar to a dark and stormy.  Second, I'm planning to keep the ginger chunks in primary fermentation, and add more fresh ginger to secondary fermentation.

#### The Ingredients
	* ~12oz Chopped Ginger (Skin on)
	* 2lb Panela
	* 1 Gal Water
	* 1/2 tsp Yeast Energizer
	* 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar
	* Lalvin EC-1118

#### The Process
Add all ingredients in pot (minus yeast), and slowly bring to a boil, stirring to ensure the panela dissolves completely.  Boil for ~20 minutes, covered.  After boiling, bring to room temperature, pour in fermenter, and pitch yeast.

Fermenting at ~68F until done.

Started 11/18

#### Update: 11/25
Fermentation is pretty much complete.  Removed from temperature control and left at RT.

#### Update: 11/28
Racked to secondary fermenter with additional 12oz Chopped Ginger.  Ginger was vacuum sealed and cooked at 80C for ~2hr to sanitize.

#### Update: 12/15
Bottled, primed with dextrose, target 3 vol CO2.

#### Tasting Notes
Forthcoming!
