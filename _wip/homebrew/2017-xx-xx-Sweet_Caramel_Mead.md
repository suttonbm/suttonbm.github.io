Adapted from a recipe found at [HBT](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=68519)

Batch Size: 1 Gallon
Target OG: 1.126
Target FG: 1.010
Yeast: K1V-1116

2 Cans Apple Juice Concetrate
0.6lb Crystal 60L
0.4lb Light DME
2.25lb Clover Honey
1/4tsp KHCO3

Steep grains in ~1qt water at 165F for 20 minutes.  Add DME and bring to boil.  Boil for 10 min.  Add honey, then juice concentrate.  Water up to 1 gallon.  Pitch 1 packet K1V-1116 rehydrated in go-ferm.

SNA Schedule:
**Target Per Addition:** 22ppm
| | **Fermaid O** | **Fermaid K** | **DAP** | **Total** |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| First Addition 24h | 0.70g | 0.0g | 0.0g | 31.6ppm |
| Second Addition 48h | 0.30g | 0.59g | 0.00g | 26.5ppm |
| Third Addition 72h | 0.30g | 0.59g | 0.00g | 26.5ppm |
| Final Addition 96h | 0.83g | 0.0g | 0.00g | 31.5ppm |

Nutrients were adjusted (approximately) to account for nutrients in the apple juice.  K1V is a strain with moderate YAN requirements; for this gravity must,
it should take ~250mgN/L, but I adjusted that down to ~120mgN/L.  Who knows if that is accurate, but I'll find out if I end up with rocket fuel :).  Various sources suggest that melomels or cysers can have nutrient additions halved.

Secondary Additions:
1 Vanilla Bean
1 Cinnamon Stick

Split/scrape vanilla bean, break up cinammon stick, and add to 6oz neutral spirit.  Allow to sit for ~2-3 days before adding to secondary.

Let age for a few months and taste.  If it needs sweetening, stabilize and add up to 0.2lb additional honey.
