Partners for Progress reported it gave more than $10,000 in both direct and in-kind contributions to Mayor Tony Mack in the two weeks leading up to his victory in the mayoral runoff election June 15.
And when it's often difficult to predict a law's impact, legislators should think twice before carrying any bill. Is it absolutely necessary? Is it an issue serious enough to merit their attention? Will it definitely not make the situation worse?

Here is why Wandry matters. Our current system imposes a gift tax of up to 35% when taxpayers give assets away, with exceptions. Individuals now get one $5.12 million lifetime exemption, and they can also give up to $13,000 of assets a year to an unlimited number of recipients. (Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.

I liked theCareerBuilder.comad with the harried office worker and the chimpanzees. And I'm a sucker for the e-Trade babies, although this one yesterday wasn't as edgy and fun as the first two incarnations. And the Bud Light rescue dog Weego was OK, although it went on too long.

Not just by the one who's left at home, wondering whose number that is on your cellphone and where you got those grass stains on your shirt collar, but also by the third party who can reject your advances to go with another suitor.
Though Maryland is the wealthiest state in the country, all Maryland's children are not equal. Maryland is not exempt from the conditions that allowed the Trayvon Martin tragedy to occur. Our battle for equity for all of our children is not just against individuals, it is against established systems and institutions. Child-wellbeing indicators show disparities from infancy to adulthood. See Advocates for Children and Youth at http://www.acy.org for more information. There are health disparities in infant mortality and low-birthweight babies. There are educational disparities in academic achievement and disparate administering of school discipline policies such as suspensions, expulsions, and school-based arrests. There are child welfare system disparities that show children of color being removed from home at higher rates than their white counterparts. There are juvenile justice system disparities at every stage from arrest to placement to youth being tried as adults.
It isn’t a question of whether the school wants the former Florida and Utah coach. It’s a question of whether he wants the school. Why would he step into this cesspool when he can have his pick of jobs?

"Be quick, but don't hurry."
In light of Alex Gonzalez's 413-foot homer on his previous at-bat, Lohse didn't seem to mind walking Gonzalez to load the bases. He did, however, mind walking George Kottaras on a 3-1 pich well out of the strike zone.

Light, simple, and relying heavily on stove-top and cold preparation, crab might make a nice early Thanksgiving menu for those who must shuttle between families. It could also work for families like mine who eat late and want a snack but must keep the oven free for the hated bird.
The new law, which takes effect immediately, requires bareheaded riders 21 and older to carry at least $20,000 in additional medical insurance. Riders also must have passed a motorcycle safety course or have had their motorcycle endorsement for at least two years.

The fires shown here all are estimated to have burned more than 100 acres, but the data does not include some grass fires that burned fewer than 300 acres.

"We don't think $458 million is representative of the cost of this project," said Obletz. "We think that number represented a series of the most expensive sub-options.

Bynum won the tip. The ball was brought downcourt and Bynum slammed it home. In fact Bynum had six of the Lakers first 12 points. Pau Gasol was also effective with four of the points, meaning that 10 of the Lakers' first 12 points were by the big men.

The Associated Press reported earlier this month that the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, does not report attacks in which the Afghan wounds  or misses  his U.S. or allied target. It also doesn't report the wounding of troops who were attacked alongside those who were killed.

"They're supposed to be all checked out," said the father of the teenage girl involved in the incident. "Something is not right."
People close to the Edwardses, speaking privately, say they have been torn about whom to support. The former North Carolina senator is concerned that Obama may not be ready for the presidency and that his health care plan is inferior. But Edwards was highly critical of Clinton -- her policies, her ties to special interests and her character -- during his campaign, making it more difficult to support her now.

Set designer Bjorn G. Amelan has supplied transparent room-dividers and a sofa, wryly suggesting that Jones’ memories resemble mental furniture. Much of this brilliant work, set to an eclectic score by Ted Coffey, depends upon a tension between the immediacy of lived experience—dancing, or biting into a juicy, green apple—and our subsequent need to measure, re-arrange and transmit our impressions before they vanish forever.

They signed Brandon Jackson, Dimitri Patterson and Usama Young.

Thus, San Antonio and Oklahoma City posted the top two records in the West. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, not the Coach of the Year for nothing, defiantly rested his stars in a rebuke to the 66-game sprint. It worked; the Spurs won 50 games. Oklahoma City's best players aren't old enough to know tired.
