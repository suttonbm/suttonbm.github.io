Today marks the beginning of our three-day stay in Hue.  This city is particularly special because it is where Diana&#8217;s family has its roots.  To start off the day, I decided to take a shower.  It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that showers are short here, but our hotel took it to a whole new extreme.  Luckily, the showerhead was removable.  Otherwise, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have washed anything above my bellybutton.  To make matters worse, the tub hardly drained at all.  By the end of a 5min shower, I was standing in three inches of dirty, lukewarm water.  Diana showered after me, and got to enjoy the scummy water up to her calves.  Luckily, things only improved from this point.

For breakfast, Bac Mua (Diana&#8217;s Dad&#8217;s Friend #2) took us for Bun Cua/Bun Bo (Crab/Beef Noodles).  This meal was my second real experience with street food (after Mui Ne).  It wasn&#8217;t my favorite meal, shadiness aside.  The broth was pretty delicious, as were the noodles.  However, I went with the beef noodles and found the meat to be a little cartilagey (that&#8217;s a word, right?) for my taste.  Diana loved it, of course.  The crab was pretty good, but again, the shell pieces and occasional sand bits were slightly offputting for my palate.  Diana and I did have a little tiff over the coffee that we ordered afterwards, because it was served over ice.  I decided not to drink it, but Diana insisted (against my better judgement) that we couldn&#8217;t let it go to waste.  No big deal, though, Diana had a short cry and we went on with the day.

After breakfast we took a short detour to pick up Diana&#8217;s favorite dessert, Banh It Den, which is essentially a black tapioca pocket filled with beans and wrapped in a banana leaf (you don&#8217;t eat the leaf).  At first I found it a little bland, but it grew on me.  While we ate, we headed over to the Imperial City to see some of the old buildings where emperors used to spend their days doing emperor things.

The Imperial City was pretty impressive while at the same time, somewhat somber.  Much of the city was ruined by a combination of natural wear and human destruction during the Vietnam War.  It was interesting to see partially or completely restored buildings juxtaposed next to crumbling walls or even piles of rubble.  Still, even the most worn buildings (that were still standing, that is) showed impressive handiwork and a strong oriental influence in the architecture and aesthetic.

Next stop after the city was lunch at O Lit&#8217;s garden house.  It was too far to walk and too hard to access by taxi, so we decided to have a try at getting around like the locals.  Our hotel offered mopeds for rent at a whopping rate of $4/day.  After some slightly awkward fumbling, they gave me a demonstration of how to work the thing and let us go on our way.  Pretty impressive for these people to trust a random dude who&#8217;s obviously never driven a moped before.  Lucky for me, we left right in the middle of lunch time.  Lunch here stretches from 11-2, and is marked by an impressive decline in street traffic and an equally impressive increase in the number of people napping in random hammocks around the city.

Lunch with O Lit was an interesting culinary adventure into standard (actual &#8211; not restaurant) Vietnamese food.  The meal was all family style, with a bowl of rice for each person and a dozen little plates or bowls in the center of the table with meat, veggies, soup, etc.  The food was all pretty good, although I did have to exit my comfort zone a couple of times.  Of course, O Lit is super super sweet, and always thinks we haven&#8217;t eaten enough, so we were pretty much force-fed by a 60lb lady with no teeth.  Side note: I was pretty impressed that the same old lady still chows down on chewy hunks of fatty meat, completely unhindered by the lack of ability to do anything but gum it.

After lunch we hopped back on the moped to go back to the hotel and look for a tailor to make us some matching pajamas :).  However, when we left, it was definitely NOT lunch hour any more.  The traffic was pretty hairy, and at one point, my life flashed before my eyes when some crazy taxi just pulled right out in front of me without slowing down.  I fumbled a bit to find the brake and was able to avoid a collision.  About two seconds later the taxi was driving past and made some sort of hand gesture while frowning at me and shaking his head.  I assume this was a Vietnamese finger, but I can&#8217;t be too sure.  We arrived safely back at the hotel and decided we weren&#8217;t going to be doing that again in Hue.

After we stopped at the Tailor, we headed down the street for dinner with Diana&#8217;s previous student.  Giang learned english from Diana while Diana was here for six months before med school.  We had a 5 course meal of sushi and other japanese entrees.  This was our most expensive meal so far, a grand total of $60 for five people.
