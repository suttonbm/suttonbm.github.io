Today was a day of travel and ripoffs, wrapped up at the end by good food and some laughs.

Our morning started at hotel checkout.  Since our previous encounter with the aggressive hotel dude, we hadn’t really seen him around at all.  There was an older guy and two young men (maybe 18) who had been courteously helping us with various needs.  Diana and I had really come to enjoy their service and positive attitude, and hoped to get luck with checkout.  When we got downstairs, we saw one of the guys (sons of the owner?) at the front desk and shared a collective sigh of relief.  He began calculating our bill and rang it up to 168,000d TOTAL for two nights.  This was less than our expected rate for one night, and were in the process of figuring it out when our \*favorite\* jerk-face rode up on his moped.  He strutted into the hotel and said “no, 200 a night”.  We gave him the 400d, and he followed up with “plus 50d per night for AC”.  If you read back a couple days ago, this was advertised as 15d per night.  Diana got a little heated, but I just paid him and we walked out.  We were both pretty pissed, and the assumption is that he was gouging us for not buying a tour at the hotel.  After that, I’m glad we didn’t &#8211; it probably would have been really crappy.  Nevertheless, we caught our bus and left the Cat Ba Dream and its perplexing staff behind.

As a whole, today’s travel schedule was the following:
  
bus, boat, bus, taxi, taxi, bus, plane, taxi

The first two legs were fine &#8211; they were both less than an hour, and for the most part relaxing.  I think the first bus ride featured some locals shouting through the phone in Vietnamese, but that is to be expected on a bus.  The second bus leg is where it got painful.  That leg runs from Hai Phong to Hanoi, roughly a 2 hour ride.  For the entire ride, we got to enjoy Vietnamese opera played loudly on the TV in the front.  I’m not sure if it’s a communism thing or just the bus driver’s taste, but every single song sounded the same.  I don’t mean that every Vietnamese word sounds the same just because I don’t speak it.  I mean that every song was literally the same.  Same key signature, same chord progression, very similar melodies.  It just droned on for hours, and at a level where I couldn’t easily drown it out with the iPod.

After the bus ride, we were faced with the tough decision of choosing a taxi driver to take us to Diana’s uncle’s house.  Finding a taxi isn’t hard &#8211; there were probably 30 drivers cramming into the bus exit trying to get us to come with them.  We just picked a random dude, based on whoever followed us the longest.  The guy we picked must have also liked music, which he courteously shared with us.  Luckily, it was different from the opera, but I can’t really comment on whether it was better.  He seemed to listen to (in my opinion) crummy techno remixes of random 80’s songs by Vietnamese singers.  He also really liked to talk.  This was another interesting example of the northern dialect of Vietnamese language.  Our driver was actually pretty helpful, but every time he talked, it sounded like he was shouting at us.  It’s not the volume of the talking, but the way the words are spoken.  The language is harsh, staccato, and rapid.

After a few detours (I think the driver took the long way….) we arrived at Diana’s Uncle’s place.  It was a pretty awkward visit &#8211; we had no idea what he looked like, and Diana wasn’t even sure what his name was.  The first observation was made was that he and his family seem to have a much lower standard of living than the rest of Diana’s family.  He and his wife are nearly 80, and their son, daughter, and her two children all live with them in a small house down a back alley.  It seems their son also has some special needs, and requires care.  They were both really nice people, and her uncle kept making statements “I’m not vietcong!!”.  He explained that he’s lived in the same place for 65 years, since before the French gave up control of Vietnam as a colony.  Diana felt so bad for their living condition and so appreciative of their hospitality that we left them $100 to help out ($100 goes a long way here).

After exhausting all conversation options, we called the same taxi driver back to take us to the airport.  Apparently he’d never been to the airport before, and took us to the wrong terminal.  We had to catch a shuttle bus to the correct terminal before we could check in and go through security.  After that, the travel went swimmingly; we got back to Saigon and met up with Diana’s Dad at the baggage claim.

We decided earlier to stay with Diana’s Dad’s Friend for our last two nights in Vietnam, and arrived there fairly late.  None of us had eaten, so we went down the street to get some crab.  The food was pretty good, although it always seems like the meat inside a crab is insufficient to reward the work required to retrieve it.  Diana was saying that the place we ate was something like a Vietnamese Hooters.  About 30 seconds after we arrived, a couple girls walked over, giggling hysterically, with a big can of beer.  They said, “we decided to give this to you because you are so tall”.  They couldn’t even make eye contact with me without giggling repeatedly…  Nevertheless, free beer!

After dinner we ran a couple loads of laundry and packed it in for the night.
