This morning I woke up at 430 in the AM. I decided to get Banh Mi Op La and Banh Bao for breakfast, but didn&#8217;t realize that the cook added cilantro, cucumber, and carrots in the Banh Mi, so Ben refused to eat it. Ben is a picky butthead. Hopefully, I will get back to you in 48 hours and let you know if I have developed any traveler&#8217;s diarrhea.  My dad hired a taxi driver to drive us to Phan Thiet and Mui Ne.  After we packed our stuff and left the hotel, we headed to my dad&#8217;s best friend (nameless) house. He lives in the Highland Park of Saigon ($800k house!!). Behind a wrought iron gate and a sad, sick looking Rottweiler, we were greeted by him and his wife with a backdrop of dozens of orchids on the wall. He lead us into his office space and we were bedazzled by the beautiful antiques in the room.  He has a black market collection of historical artifact in his second floor office, including many ivory carvings, jade carvings and fine porcelain.  After hours of catching up, we had breakfast together. Ben and I ordered a rice pork dish that is inferior, in my opinion, to La Me. After breakfast, my dad bid farewell to his best friend and wife and we headed off towards Phan Thiet.

Oh, how the drive was so long and boring.  I was quite uncomfortable in the back seat as I had a giant next to me whose legs was taking up my space!!! During this 5 hour drive, I slept, ate, drank and played cards. Can you believe that during the whole car ride, my dad never stopped talking! It was just blah blah blah blah blah for 5 hours!!

When we arrived in Phan Thiet, Chi Phoung (my sister in law)&#8217;s sister took us to a temple that house a 50 m Fin whale skeleton. Oh my, it was humungous. After the temple, we took a brief jaunt on the beach, where the wind was so strong that it was sand blasting my face. We returned back to their house, and Chi Phuong&#8217;s dad and her sister took us to a seafood restaurant in Mui Ne.  Our table was overlooking the beautiful sea.  We had an extravagant and delicious seafood dinner, consisting of snails (which I am surprise Ben ate, though he had some level of trepidation), squid, octopus, vegetables and crab. I ate the crab&#8217;s brain and squishy things because Ben didn&#8217;t want to try the green goo&#8230; He&#8217;s not quite at that level yet&#8230;.. soon&#8230; muahahahahahahahahaha&#8230;..

Vietnamese dinners are known to last for hours, as Vietnamese people like to chat without end. Poor Ben&#8230; After dinner, we headed to the sand dunes. Unfortunately, the sun already set, so we were not able to really enjoy the sand dunes. We left the dunes and headed towards the street lined with countless number of resorts. We randomly picked a resort that had a sign hanging on their tree, saying &#8220;15USD/night.&#8221; We passed out by 7 pm.
