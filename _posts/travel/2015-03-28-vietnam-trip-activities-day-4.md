Catching up now on the days missed due to travel and full schedules :).

Thursday, we got up pretty early but had a slow start to activities.  We got breakfast with Diana&#8217;s Dad&#8217;s Friend&#8217;s (DDF&#8217;s) Wife, which consisted of really freaking awesome Pho from a little restaurant down the street.  There, they make their own noodles by hand and scoop the hot broth out of a giant kettle with a giant-er ladle.  The broth was especially delicious, and tasted more strongly of nutmeg and other spices than Pho I&#8217;ve had in the past.  It really complemented the meatball and beef flavors well.  I think, maybe, I&#8217;m starting to get used to this whole idea of street food after all.

After breakfast, we headed into the city to get coffee and pastries at Sozo coffeeshop, a nice little hole in the wall that trains and employs disadvantaged Vietnamese people.  Diana had a really yummy cinnamon roll, and I had a tasty but slightly dense slices of carrot cake.  We both also enjoyed Vietnamese style coffee, which is essentially an espresso shot mixed with condensed milk.  Really strong, really sweet, really yummy.

Just down the street from Sozo, we stopped at the Sapa store, which supports the local tribes in Sapa Valley, who hand-make clothing, accessories, and various stuffed items.  We picked up a couple gifts for people along with the obligatory turtle to join my collection at work.

For lunch, we headed back over to DDF&#8217;s house to have a traditional Vietnamese meal.  DDF&#8217;s wife is a well-known chef in Vietnam, and her claim to fame is learning to cook the food that dynastic royalty used to enjoy hundreds of years ago.  Our meal was a three-course vegetarian meal with a fried corn wrap appetizer, vegetable noodle soup, and sweet corn pudding.

The first half of the day was pretty uneventful.  Then, things got really interesting.  After lunch we headed to the airport to catch a plane to Hue, Diana&#8217;s parents&#8217; hometown.  Everything went swimmingly from check-in to take-off.  However, instead of taking the expected 65 minutes, this flight ended up eating 6 hours.

First of all, the nuns.  There were something like 30 catholic/buddhist nuns on our flight.  They were seated right around our row, and really very nice, but perhaps a bit &#8220;bumbling&#8221;.  It seemed like they were excited to be off on a nun adventure to somewhere.  As expected, Diana&#8217;s dad found a nun who knew him, and they became best friends within 5 minutes.  More on the bumbling nuns later.

On our initial descent into Hue, things seemed to be just fine.  It was a little bit cloudy and a little but bumpy, but nothing too crazy in my experience.  Diana was pretty freaked.  But then, confusingly, we just started circling at the same altitude for about five minutes before the pilot gunned it and took us from about 100m to 5,000m in about 30 seconds.  We got back up to cruising altitude and started flying in a straight path.  Diana, at this point, was beside herself to the point of needed a sick-bag to relieve her indigestion.  For about 15 minutes, we continued flying with no explanation from the flight crew.  I had to keep convincing myself we weren&#8217;t flying off to Russia or some kind of shady nonsense like that.  It got pretty tense for a little bit.  But then, we finally got the announcement from the pilot that strong winds would prevent us from landing in Hue.  We had to divert temporarily to Danang, about 20 min south.

Once we got to Danang, we disembarked from the plane and hung out in the airport for about an hour.  There were a few pissy passengers, but we stayed rather chill about the whole thing.  Of course, the nuns got on their cell phones and must have called up a local temple/order and arranged for ground transportation the rest of the way.  They had the airline pull their luggage off the plane so they could go on their way.  About 10 minutes after this transpired, we began boarding the plane again.  We got everyone sans nuns onto the plane in about 15 minutes, but we still didn&#8217;t leave.  What the heck was going on??  About 10 more minutes later, and in walk the nuns.  They get comfy in their seats, everyone is buckled in, and we&#8230;.. sit.  It took maybe 20 more minutes, and the flight crew finally announced that &#8220;sorry, we are waiting on baggage from a few passengers who wanted to take ground transportation&#8221;&#8230;  These stinking nuns!  At the very least, they had a copious quantity of snacks which they shared with everyone nearby.  I tried dried watermelon seeds for the first time, and was surprised that they taste like pumpkin seeds.

Finally, we arrived in Hue at about 9:00p.  Our original flight was due in at 3:00p.

From the airport, we went straight to meet Diana&#8217;s favorite, famous Aunt, O Lit.  She lives in one of six garden houses in Hue, known for having large plots of land and old houses with traditional architecture.  O Lit is pretty awesome &#8211; she&#8217;s 87 and lives in this house with few modern conveniences (she has a well in her backyard and sleeps on a wooden bed), has no teeth, and probably weighs 60 pounds.  But, she&#8217;s always smiling and talks to me like I understand Vietnamese.  That night, she dragged me around the house to see everything with a vice grip on my forearm.  For being so tiny, she has a grip of steel.  At the end of the tour, she grabbed a couple random boxes of crackers and practically force-fed Diana and I.  After our short visit, we headed to our hotel and crashed for the night.
