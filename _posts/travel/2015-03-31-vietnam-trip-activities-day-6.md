  twinky PJ&#8217;s!

Today, we started with a tour.  We signed up for a full-day trip to all the popular tourist spots in the city, including the Imperial City, a garden house, a pagoda, some tombs, and an incense maker. Since we saw the imperial city yesterday, we decided to skip it and try to find Diana&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s house.  Diana thought it was just a few blocks down the street.  20 minutes later, we still hadn&#8217;t found it.  On top of that, we were taking our lovely stroll in a torrential downpour.  We both had raincoats and were diligently wearing them, but hadn&#8217;t really considered the bottom half.  By the end of the walk, we were both completely drenched below the waist.  Of course, right around the time we returned to the bus, the rain let up to a gentle mist.

Next stop on the tour was a garden house.  In Hue, there are six garden houses with traditional vietnamese architecture, named for the large property covered with flowers, fruit trees, and other vegetation.  We both think that our tour should have stopped to see O Lit, but instead they went down the road to some other place.  It was in better shape than O Lit&#8217;s place, but there was no kindly little old lady there to greet us with a grin and snacks.  We snapped a couple photos and mused a bit about how hard it would be to live in a house that was also a tourist destination.  I would really hate having a bunch of nosy foreigners poking around in my stuff and taking pictures everywhere.

After the garden house, we went to the Thien Mu pagoda.  It is an active buddhist community most well known for the famous monk Thich Quang Duc, who committed self-immolation during the vietnam war.  The car he drove to the site of his protest is still housed in the garage there.  Aside from the car, the pagoda has a number of beautiful buildings as well as excellent landscaping.  However, due to the rain, we refrained from snapping any photos here today.

After the pagoda, we stopped for lunch (which was really unimpressive).  Lucky for us, it was included in the cost of our $7 tour.  We ate our fill and spent 15 or 20 minutes chatting outside next to a cumquat tree.

After lunch we stopped at three different tombs: Emperor Minh Mang, Emperor Khai Dinh, and Emperor Tu Duc.  Somewhat surprisingly, the three tombs were all very different.  Pictures below show the tombs of Khai Dinh and Tu Duc.  Minh Mang&#8217;s looked just like the whole imperial city, so we refrained from more snapshots.

Right in the middle of all the tomb stops, the highlight of the trip was a broken starter on the bus.  We had stopped at a &#8220;market&#8221; to buy souvenirs (or rather, so they could sell them), and the stop seemed to be taking longer than planned.  It took a while to realize that the bus driver and our tour guide were running around behind the bus with random tools doing something.  We got off the bus to see what was up and found the engine cover up and the battery cable hanging out.  They initially thought that a loose connection was preventing the bus from starting, but even after some ad-hoc repairs, it still wouldn&#8217;t start.  In order to get back on the road, we ended up needing to jump start the engine by popping the clutch.  It took some 10 dudes to push the bus fast enough to get it started, and took us an extra 45 minutes of sitting around while the driver tried to figure out what was wrong.

After we finished up our tour, we went over to Bac Mua&#8217;s house for a delicious, home-cooked vietnamese meal.  We had banana soup, fig salad, and DIY spring rolls.  The food was absolutely amazing &#8211; probably the best on the trip so far.  We ate to the point of bursting.  It is apparently a universal truth here that relatives will force-feed family to the point of stomach explosion during visits.

The last activity of today was pick-up of our twinky PJ&#8217;s!  I wanted to get a nice, tailored PJ pants and top, and talked Diana into getting a matching set herself.  They aren&#8217;t the cheapest souvenir ($35/ea), but they are definitely the most functional and comfy :).
