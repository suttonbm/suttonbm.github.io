  ... 40 cans of Ensure powder ...

After a torturous, grueling 30 hours of travel (including 19 hours in economy plane seats :O), Diana and I arrived in Saigon, Vietnam around 10:30p local time.  We were greeted at the airport by massive crowds of people waiting for family members or whatever, plus one of Diana&#8217;s Dad&#8217;s friends from the old days.  Of course, Diana&#8217;s Dad packed up a variety of gifts for various people &#8211; not the least of which, being 40 cans of Ensure powder packed in four checked bags (I&#8217;ve since learned after the fact that Vietnamese people like practical gifts).

We arrived at the hotel somewhere around midnight.  We&#8217;ll be staying at Hotel Hai Yen for two nights.  Between a deep freezer AC unit in the room and incessant honking, grumbling motorcycles and their yelling operators, Diana and I managed to get a whopping 3 hours of sleep the first night.  Granted, Diana slept about six hours total on the plane.  I slept about one.

As it turns out, sunrise here is at about 5:30am, so we were up pretty early.  None of us had exchanged any money yet, so we couldn&#8217;t really do anything until Diana&#8217;s Dad&#8217;s friend (Khoi) came to get us.  Diana was whining from 6:30-7:30 about how her stomach acid was eating her intestines for lack of sustenance.  To distract her, we took a brief walk up and down the road so I could get my first taste of Saigon.

When Khoi arrived (Vietnamese time is minimum 20min behind whatever you agree on) we all went out for a steaming bowl of Pho for breakfast.  Of course, Diana didn&#8217;t go easy on me, and went ahead and ordered the deluxe bowl.  Deluxe means throw whatever random pieces of meat, fat, bones, and trimmings you have into the broth.  I can officially say I&#8217;ve eaten tripe, and probably some other things that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to identify for anyone.  I also enjoyed a glass of freshly made carrot juice.

After breakfast, Diana and I went off to do our own thing.  Our first stop was the War Remnants Museum (could also be called the USA sucks propaganda museum).  Despite the frequent appearance of pro-north historical commentary, there was a impressive documentation of some of the really not so great things that the US did during the Vietnam war.  In addition, there was a pretty cool collection of wartime equipment parked in the front courtyard, including planes, tanks, artillery guns, and various shells.  We breezed through pretty quickly, as the pictures of various wartime tragedies was a little too much to walk through one at a time.

Our next stop was intended to be the reunification palace, but we couldn&#8217;t figure out how to actually get inside.  I think it was during our stroll around the perimeter wall that we discovered sidewalks are also roads.  Despite the anticlimactic attempt to see the palace, our walk ended at a nice little park where we took a brief respite under the trees.  After taking a good 15 minutes to relax and people watch in the park, the next stop was a short jaunt over to the famous Notre Dame cathedral, Weeping Mary statue, and French-Era Post Office.  After snapping a few mandatory tourist photos, we went into the post office for a couple of postcards and mailed them on the spot.

The next next stop was a short cab ride away to the Jade Emperor Pagoda.  There was a cool collection of Chinese statues and carvings, but the main attraction was probably the small pool outside, where some 100 turtles are living.  After completing this somewhat underwhelming stop, we took a good stroll down to the botanical gardens and historical museum only to find them closed on Mondays.  Two strikes, team!

Somewhere around this point in today&#8217;s journey, Diana realized that we had not written down the address to our tiny little hotel, and without any good way to contact her dad, we were rather stuck.  In a desperate attempt to keep ourselves occupied, we decided to take a cab ride to the Ben Thanh market.  It was actually pretty convenient, as I forgot to pack my sandals and Diana needed some hair ties.  As we walked around the market, I discovered three things.  First, 95 degrees with 80% humidity and no airflow = no bueno (I guess that&#8217;s kinda common sense).  Second, it is amazing how many people can cram into a 24 inch aisle between stalls of random, colorful trinkets, fabric, and accessories.  Third, I&#8217;m literally a giant.  I also went ahead and purchased a pair of far overpriced knockoff Clark sandals, but that&#8217;s really a minor detail of this stop.

After sweating out all the moisture in our bodies, Diana and I had to find some hydration.  We found a coffee shop with free wifi and ordered some flavored tea (yummy but really sweet, and with real peaches!).  Diana was able to get in contact with a local friend via Facebook, and luckily, he was able to help us find the address of our hotel.  CRISIS AVERTED!

We weren&#8217;t ready to head back after our tea, and Diana was feeling pretty tense, so we decided it was time for a massage.  We took a nice 15 minute walk down the street to a fairly unassuming location where a local organization train and support blind people in the art of traditional Vietnamese massage.  Diana and I both got a one hour massage, and left feeling loosened up and refreshed.  Plus, on our way to the massage place, we got to experience how the locals get exercise.  Diana had a good workout on some of the equipment :).

Dinner happened at a little shop just next door to the hotel.  The food seemed a little shady, so we&#8217;ll see how I&#8217;m feeling in the morning ;).  Diana was completely unperturbed.  On a positive note, the total meal came to ~200,000d ($10) for three people.

After dinner we went back towards the market to have a stroll and an Avocado smoothie.  The traffic was unbelievable.  It was like Dallas at rush hour, except more chaos and with mopeds.  Instead of service roads, the bikers use the sidewalks when things back up too much.  Makes for some tricky dodges when you&#8217;re just trying to mosey along at a comfortably slow pace.

All in all, it was a pretty good day.  We accomplished a lot, saw a lot, experienced a lot&#8230;  And are totally wiped out (we passed out for 90min at 7:30, and are already ready for bed.
