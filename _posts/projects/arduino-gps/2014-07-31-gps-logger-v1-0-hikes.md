While on vacation with my family in July, I made good use of my [GPS Logger]({{ site.url }}/2014/07/gps-hike-logger-revision-1/) project. Over the course of a week, we took five hikes, ranging from 3-11 miles round trip. Combined with a very handy online tool for creating [maps from GPS data](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/), I was able to generate some pretty neat maps.

See pictures of the sights along these hikes here.

# [Alta Vista Trail](http://visitrainier.com/pg/hike/14/alta+vista+trail)

Great hike up near the glaciers on Mt. Rainier. Despite being the middle of the summer there was tens of feet of snow over most of the trail.

# [Hoh River Trail](http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/hoh-river-trail.htm)

The Hoh River runs through the heart of the rainforest in Olympic National Park. The size of the Sitka Spruce, Douglas Fir, and Pacific Redcedar rival even the Redwoods for height and girth here.

# Kayaking Trip
  
In addition to the four hikes, we also took a kayaking trip along the north shore of the Olympic peninsula. Along this shoreline there are miles of cliffs up to 300ft high, and a plethora of oceanic wildlife, such as starfish, kelp, crabs, and anemones.
