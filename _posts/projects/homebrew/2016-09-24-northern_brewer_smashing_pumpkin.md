  Northern Brewer's Smashing Pumpkin Ale!
---

Brewed a 1-gallon small batch kit of Northern Brewer's Smashing Pumpkin Ale!  Ingredients list follows:

  * Steeping Grains (in bag) - Briess Caramel 40?
  * 1.5lb Gold Malt Syrup
  * 3.5g Cascade Hops (pellets)
  * 1.4tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice
  * Safale US-05

Note that this particular kit is not a pure extract; the first step is steeping the malted grain.

The ingredients (grains not shown):

### The Process

The procedure I used for the brew was as follows:

  * Clean/sanitize, etc
  * Pour 1.25 gallons water into brew kettle
  * Raise to 165F and kill heat
  * Steep specialty grains
    * 24 minutes steep
    * Start temp 164F
    * End temp 148F
    * Turned heat on low after ~15min to keep temp up
  * Remove grains (didn't sqeeze out water)
  * Bring water to boil
  * Add malt syrup
  * Bring back to boil
  * Add cascade hops, boil for 45min
  * Kill heat, add spices, cover
  * Cool wort using ice bath

#### Action Shot: During Steeping

After cooling, I suddenly realized I was short on volume and high on SG, so I had to add some water:

  * Heat 1.5 qt water to almost boiling (to sanitize)
  * Cool to temp of wort and add to fermentation bucket
  * Pitch 1/2 packet US-05

OG: 1.050 @ 80F (1.052 adj to 60F)

#### Update:
Fermented out in about a week, but I left it in the fermenter for another ~10 days before bottling.  Flavor was a little disappointing for me.  Barely any spice flavor to it.  It's a decent brown ale, but nothing more than that.
