  Tart, dry, berry cider
---

Going to try and make a combination fruity cider with blackberries (and maybe cranberries).  I'm thinking I'll start with a base apple cider, then perform a secondary fermentation with raw fruit or high quality juice.

TreeTop Cider, 1gal.  EC-1118 pitched dry.  Ferment at 68F RT.

#### 4/30/17
Racked onto an arbitrary qty of frozen mixed berries (1-1.5lb) and added one campden tablet.
