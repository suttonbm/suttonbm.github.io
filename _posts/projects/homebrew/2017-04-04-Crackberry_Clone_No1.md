  Tart, dry, berry cider
---

Going to try and make a combination fruity cider with blackberries (and maybe cranberries).  I'm thinking I'll start with a base apple cider, then perform a secondary fermentation with raw fruit or high quality juice.

TreeTop Cider, 1gal.  EC-1118 pitched dry.  Ferment at 68F RT.

#### 4/30/17
Racked onto an arbitrary qty of frozen mixed berries (1-1.5lb) and added one campden tablet.

#### 5/9/17
Racked to tertiary to clear.  Flavor is quite nice, but a bit tart.  Lots of berries come through nicely.

#### 6/16/17
Bottled, target carb 2.5 vol.

Wastage tasting!
Appearance: Bright red and clear.
Nose: Almost like honey.  Hope I didn't mix this up with another experiment ._.  Definite fresh fruit/berries there as well.
Flavor: Light, with berries at the forefront.  Some alcohol percieved, but not a huge amount.  I think it could have used a bit more acidity to balance the flavor.

Assuming I didn't screw up, this should carb in the next few weeks.  Will be interesting to see how it tastes once there is no residual sugar and the carbonation is there to add a bit more acidity to the flavor.  I think this should end up being a pretty refreshing drink.

Yeah, I screwed up.  I think that I added:

Wine Tannin 0.53g
Acid Blend 0.71g
Clover Honey 3.8oz (by wt)

sometime around a month ago.  Sampled today, and flavor was OK, if a little watery.  Probably need to stick with carbonating this.  Will schedule bottling sometime soon.  May need to repitch yeast since this has been sitting so long.

#### 8/26/2017
Bottled at 2.5vol target.  Added a bit of EC-1118 to supplement the yeast since it's been so long.
