  Well, I'm hooked...

I had fun brewing my [first beer]({{ base.url }}/2016/08/bb_belgian_tripel/).  However, I'm still coming to grips with the length of time required to produce a decent product.  I mentioned before that I'm going to let my tripel age for about 3 months before I consume any of it.  It's just too long to wait, and more than that, I can't try anything else in the meantime.  So I bought two more fermenters :D.

Turns out Lowe's carries some 2-gallon, food-grade HDPE buckets for about 3-4 bucks, so I went ahead and picked up two, a couple airlocks from my local homebrew store, and some rubber grommets to use for fitting the airlocks to the bucket lids.

So what am I going to do with these two new fermenters?  Tie them up for three months, of course...

In an effort to create some delicious drinks that the lovely Diana and my celiac Dad could drink, I decided to try making some Apfelwein and Mead.  I'm (trying) to follow recipes that I found up on the [Homebrew Talk Forum](http://www.homebrewtalk.com): [Joe's Ancient Orange Mead](http://fuckingyum.com/2013/12/08/jaom-joes-ancient-orange-mead/), and [Edwort's Apfelwein](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=14860).  I did make a slight modification to the mead recipe, which I'll discuss below.

### Joe's Ancient Orange Mead (JAOM)
So I didn't *exactly* follow the proper JAOM recipe.  You see, the "true" recipe calls for bread yeast - Fleischmann's or any other non-fast rising yeast.  However, after quite a bit of reading on the web, it seems like the bread yeast has a lot of downsides.  The flavor can be a bit "bready", the ABV tolerance can be highly variable, and the mead may take a "long" time to become drinkable due to off flavors.  I had hoped to try using Wyeast 4184 (Sweet Mead), but the local homebrew shop doesn't stock any of this yeast.  So... I went with Red Star Montrachet wine yeast.  I don't have a good, rational justification for this choice aside from it being cheap and also used for the apfelwein recipe.

Anyways, without further ado, here's the recipe *I* used:

#### Ingredients
  * 2 Oranges
  * 6lb Generic (Kroger) Clover Honey
  * 1tsp Yeast Energizer
  * 1/2 Packet Red Star Montrachet Yeast
  * 2 Cinnamon Sticks
  * 2 Whole Cloves

#### Procedure
  * Add 8oz honey and 8oz water to a small saucepan
  * Apply high heat and stir until honey dissolves
  * When (nearly) a boil, add cinnamon and cloves
  * Add zest and juice from both oranges
  * Remove heat and allow to steep for ~10 minutes
  * Pour hot liquid into the fermenter
  * Add remaining honey to the fermenter
  * Top off with cold tap water, stir until well mixed
  * Add yeast nutrient and yeast, then seal fermenter

#### Fermentation Plan
Let it sit for two months.

#### Thoughts
It weirds me out a bit to be using tap water.  I'm not entirely clear on why this is OK for a mead, but definitely NOT ok for beer.

#### Update: 9/14/2016
Well, I didn't follow the plan.

I've been getting excited to brew some new beer, and I need to have my two 2-gallon buckets to use as primary fermenters.  So, against the better judgement of *the entire internet*, I racked the mead to secondary before the fermentation was complete.  I did take a gravity measurement - 1.032.  Pretty high after a week of fermentation, but I think the original gravity was right around 1.1 or 1.09, so it's definitely getting there.  I did notice that the scent was pretty funky - kind of like rotting oranges.  Not sure whether that is to be expected or not.  The orange peels were filtered out along with all the lees and yeast cake in the bottom of the bucket.  I didn't try a taste at this time because the scent was so off-putting, but I'll let it run for the rest of the two months I'd planned for to see what happens...

I also added 2tsp yeast nutrient and 1tsp yeast energizer after racking and sloshed around a bit to get the yeast up and running again.  Hopefully this won't stall out.

### Apfelwein
I followed the apfelwein recipe pretty much exactly.  I think I ended up with a bit more corn sugar and less apple juice than the recipe calls for due to lack of volume in the fermenter, but I can always compensate for that by making a late addition of apple juice sometime.

#### Ingredients
  * 1 Gallon Tree Top Fresh Squeezed Apple Juice
  * 1 Gallon Tree Top Cider
  * 0.8lb Corn Sugar
  * 1/2 Package Montrachet Yeast

#### Process
  * Pour half of three bottles into the fermenter
  * Split sugar into three bottles and shake to dissolve/mix
  * Pour the rest of three bottles into the fermenter
  * Top off with the final bottle
  * Sprinkle yeast over top and close fermenter

#### Fermentation Plan
Let it sit for two months

#### Thoughts
Super quick and easy!  Since the juice is pasteurized, no boiling necessary.  I recently found an organic fresh apple juice at Central Market that would be SUPER convenient for making ciders.  May have to try some more sometime :).

#### Update: 9/14/2016
Same as the mead.  It seems like the apfelwein was already pretty much done with fermentation; I measured the SG at 1.000.  Instead of racking into a single vessel, I decided to split this into two separate jugs.  My thought process is that I'll probably do half the batch sparkling and dry, and maybe leave the other one still (not sure if I'll backsweeten).  Plus, I only had one carboy large enough to hold two gallons.

Since the fermentation appeared to be almost complete, I did top up both gallon jugs with fresh organic apple juice from Central Market.  Hopefully this will make up for the shortage of juice in primary, while at the same time helping to produce some CO2 to purge oxygen from the carboy.
