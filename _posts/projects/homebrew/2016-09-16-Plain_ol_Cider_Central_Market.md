  Plain cider experiment
---

This is my first attempt at making a boring old hard cider, with nothing but apple juice, yeast, and TLC.

#### The Ingredients
  * 1 gal Central Market Organic Apple Juice (the cloudy stuff)
  * 1/2 Packet (5g) Safale US-05

#### The Process
  * Open apple juice (conveniently sold in a 1-gallon glass jug)
  * Pitch yeast
  * Apply airlock

I think this fermented dry in about a week.  Bottle carbonated to ~3 volumes CO2

#### Tasting Notes
It's just a little tart, but apple-y tart like a granny smith.  Not unpleasant.  Definitely has some nice apple flavor, and the extra fizz makes it a refreshing drink.  Pretty strong head for the first couple minutes just due to the amount of bubbles.  After some of the carbonation gets out, the head dissipates pretty quickly.

I'll probably try this one again; the flavor was quite nice.
