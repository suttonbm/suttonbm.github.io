It's been a while.  This is my second partial mash attempt.  I use partial mash loosely - it's really BIAB all grain, but since I haven't gotten my mash efficiencies up, I have to supplement with DME.

This recipe is another from [homebrewtalk](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=255659) - this time a lemon/lime hefeweisen

#### The Specifications
**Style:** German Wheat Beer
**Batch Size:** 2.65 gal
**SRM:** 4.0
**IBU:** 12
**OG:** 1.050
**FG:** 1.016

#### Ingredients
| Weight | Ingredient | Type | Pct |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.5 lbs | Pale Malt (2 Row) US (2.0 SRM) | Grain | 50 % |
| 2 lbs | Wheat Malt, Bel (2.0 SRM) | Grain | 40 % |
| 8 oz | Vienna Malt 3.5 SRM) | Grain | 10 % |
| 3.2 oz | Extra Light DME (late addition) | Grain | 5.9% |
| 0.15 oz | Motueka @ 20min | Hops | |
| 0.15 oz | Sorachi Ace @ 7min | Hops | |
| 1 pkt | Safbrew WB-06 | Yeast | |

#### Brew Process
| Mash Step | Description | Temp | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prep | Measure 15qt water in mash pot | | |
| Mash In | Add grain to pot and stir | 164F | |
| Sacch | Hold temp for required time | 156F | 60 min |
| Mash Out | Heat to mash-out temp and Hold | 162F | 10 min |
| Drain | Pull out grain bag and let drain | | |
| Measure | Collect pre-boil vol, SG | | |

#### Mash Process
The mash went much smoother this time, with my new pot and induction burner.  I ended up just a bit on the high end, but the temperature dropped low, so average was just about right.

T0 - 160F
15 min - 158F
30 min - 156F
45 min - 155F
60 min - 153F

I wrapped the pot in a spare blanket to try and conserve heat.  I also stirred the mash every 15 minutes, when checking the temperature.

I blew it and broke my hydrometer after finishing the mash, but luckily I had a spare one I picked up on CL :).

Post-Mash Measurements:
SG 1.038
Vol: 3.25 gal
Based on the above, my achieved mash efficiency was 66.3%.  (not bad considering 55% last batch!)
Added 3.2oz DME to compensate for low efficiency

Post Boil Measurements:
SG 1.050
Vol: 2.69 gal
Calculated boil-off rate: 0.56gph

Other Stats:
Started water at room temp.
Time to Mash-In: ~30 min
Time from Mash-Out to Boil: ~30 min
Time from Boil End to 80F: ~15min

#### Fermentation Plan
Fermentation target temp is 19.3C, using the fridge and temp controller.  Yeast was pitched dry at 80F (I thought it was cooler than that when I pulled out the chiller).  Next time I need to run the chiller a bit longer before transferring to the carboy.  Wort was poured into the carboy thru a funnel.  I didn't put much effort into keeping the trub out, but I did try not to dump the hop junk.

#### 8/26/2017
Bottled @ 2.7 vol.  FG 1.011, ABV ~5.25%.
