  Second attempt at alcoholic ginger beer
---

After my [first attempt at alcoholic ginger beer]({{ base.url }}/2016/09/alcoholic_ginger_beer/), I decided to give it another shot.  I'm planning to change a few things with this recipe to reduce the sour notes and hopefully improve the overall flavor.  First, instead of using white/brown sugar, I'm going to use 100% [panela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panela) (or piloncillo), essentially unrefined cane juice.  The draw for me here is a nice molasses-like flavor.  My hope is that combined with the ginger, this will yield a drink similar to a dark and stormy.  Second, I'm planning to keep the ginger chunks in primary fermentation, and add more fresh ginger to secondary fermentation.

#### The Ingredients
	* ~12oz Chopped Ginger (Skin on)
	* 2lb Panela
	* 1 Gal Water
	* 1/2 tsp Yeast Energizer
	* 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar
	* Lalvin EC-1118

#### The Process
Add all ingredients in pot (minus yeast), and slowly bring to a boil, stirring to ensure the panela dissolves completely.  Boil for ~20 minutes, covered.  After boiling, bring to room temperature, pour in fermenter, and pitch yeast.

Fermenting at ~68F until done.

Started 11/18

#### Update: 11/25
Fermentation is pretty much complete.  Removed from temperature control and left at RT.

#### Update: 11/28
Racked to secondary fermenter with additional 12oz Chopped Ginger.  Ginger was vacuum sealed and cooked at 80C for ~2hr to sanitize.

#### Update: 12/15
Bottled, primed with dextrose, target 3 vol CO2.

#### Tasting Notes
Some good news and some bad news.  The good news - adding ginger in secondary really brought back a nice ginger aroma and some of the ginger "burn".  This improved greatly upon my first attempt.  The bad news - panela tastes awful as the only source of sugar in the drink.  There is very little residual molasses or brown-sugar flavor left, and there's a strong taste which I can only describe as "minerally".  Overall, the final product tastes to me almost medicinal, but not in a good way.

Aside from taste, I also felt that it lacked in body.  The mouthfeel left much to be desired; almost coming across as fizzy water.

Considering all this, I have a few ideas for how I might improve this recipe in the future:

  * Go back to using sugar instead of panela as the primary fermentable, to avoid the mineral flavors.
  * Alternatively, consider a sugar that might impart more flavor, such as honey.
  * To address mouthfeel/body, perhaps consider adding some maltodextrin or lactose.
  * If I get a little wilder, I could also consider using extra light malt as the fermentable base, then supplement with ginger for flavor.  Might seem more like a beer than a traditional ginger beer.
