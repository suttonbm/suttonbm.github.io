  Blackberry wine, first attempt
---

This recipe comes from Jack Keller, slightly adapted as a strong melomel. [here](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/blackbr2.asp)

#### Ingredients
5lb Blackberries
3lb Wildflower Honey
1/2t Pectic Enzyme
1 campden tablet
2.5qt Water
Lalvin RC-212 Yeast

Target OG: 1.115

Actual OG: 1.1080

#### Process (Plan)
Wash berries prior to freezing.  Place frozen fruit in a nylon bag inside a sanitized bucket.  Allow to thaw for 24 hours, then crush berries and pour boiling water, over the berries.  Once room temperature, campden tablet dissolved in a little spring water.  After 24 hr, add pectic enzyme and stir.  Allow to steep for two days.  Remove bag with fruit pulp, squeeze, and discard the fiber and seeds.  Heat honey slightly and dissolve with 1/2 the must.  Pour into primary fermenter along with remaining must, top up to 1.25 gal and aerate.  Pitch yeast, hydrated in go-ferm.  Stir/aerate daily for 4 days when adding nutrients.  Pour into secondary fermenter (glass), and place in dark place or cover.  Save excess must in 1qt canning jar with an airlock.  Allow to sit for ~3 months, then rack into secondary on another campden tablet and top up with reserved must.  Bottle once clear, and allow to age for 6-12 months.

#### SNA Plan
**Target Per Addition:** 32ppm
| | **Fermaid O** | **Fermaid K** | **DAP** | **Total** |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| First Addition 24h | 1.0g | 0.0g | 0.0g | 29.6ppm |
| Second Addition 48h | 0.0g | 1.18g | 0.17g | 32.5ppm |
| Third Addition 72h | 0.0g | 1.18g | 0.17g | 32.5ppm |
| Final Addition 96h | 1.13g | 0.0g | 0.0g | 33.4ppm |

#### Comments:
I screwed up and stuck my dirty thermometer into the must when measuring volume...  Hopefully I don't end up with an infection :(.

#### Day 4:
Sealed up in the bucket after adding fourth nutrient addition.  I've been fermenting at ambient temperature given the ideal range for this yeast (20-30C).  My AC tops out at 77-78F during the day (25C).

#### 7/6/17
Racked to secondary with one campden tablet.  Reserved excess in a mason jar.  Added 6 medium+ char french oak cubes and 4 medium char american oak cubes.  Should age for ~6 months before I touch it.

#### 8/1/17
Topped up with some of the reserved wine
