Original recipe [here](http://www.winemakingtalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=41825)

#### Ingredients
4lb Triple Berry Mix (Rasp/Black/Blue)
3lb Orange Blossom Honey
1/2t Pectic Enzyme
1 campden tablet
2.5qt Water
Lalvin K1V-1116 (2.5g)

Target OG: 1.100

#### Process (Plan)
Wash berries prior to using.  Place in a nylon bag inside a bucket and crush.  Pour water, boiled, over the berries.  Once room temperature, add pectic enzyme and campden tablet dissolved in a little spring water.  Allow to steep for two days.  Remove bag with fruit pulp, squeeze, and discard the fiber and seeds.  Heat honey slightly and dissolve with 1/2 the must.  Pour into primary fermenter along with remaining must.  Confirm OG and add top-up water to reach target SG.  Pitch yeast, hydrated in go-ferm.  Stir/aerate daily for 4 days when adding nutrients.  Pour into secondary fermenter (glass), and place in dark place or cover.  Save excess must in 1qt canning jar with an airlock.  Allow to sit for ~3 months, then rack into secondary on another campden tablet and top up with reserved must.  Bottle once clear, and allow to age for 6-12 months.
