  An experiment

Recently, while searching for homebrew recipe ideas or drinks that I could make for Diana, I stumbled across a good-looking [recipe for ginger beer](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=371483).  I made a batch that turned out really well, and wanted to see if I could make a dry, alcoholic version.  After a bit of searching, I found another recipe [here](http://www.thehomebrewforum.co.uk/showthread.php?t=3826).  I decided to give it a try, with a few slight modifications.

#### The Ingredients
  * 10.6 oz Ginger
  * 1.5 tsp Dry Ginger
  * 0.25 tsp Cream of Tartar
  * Zest/Juice 2 Lemons
  * Zest/Juice 2 Limes
  * 1 cup Dk Brn Sugar
  * 1 cup White Sugar
  * 1/2 Sachet Red Star Cuvee Yeast
  * 1 tsp yeast nutrient

#### The Process
  * Add ginger, lime juice/zest, lemon juice/zest, and dry ginger to a pot with ~9 cups water
  * Bring to a boil and cook for ~30 minutes until liquid is reduced
  * Add sugar and cream of tartar, stir until dissolved
  * Strain and cool to room temperature
  * Measure out 5.5c concentrate and pour into a pan
  * Dilute with cool tap water to 1 gallon total
  * Take OG measurement and add sugar as needed to reach 1.045
  * Pour into fermenter, add yeast nutrient and yeast

Note: This actually makes ~2qt concentrate, enough for a 1.5 gallon batch OR a 2qt batch of non-alcoholic ginger beer :).

#### Update: 9/15/2016
This thing is fermenting like crazy.

#### Update: 9/18/2016
Seems like fermentation may be completed already.  Will wait a few more days and take a hydrometer reading to confirm.
