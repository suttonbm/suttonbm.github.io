  An experiment

Recently, while searching for homebrew recipe ideas or drinks that I could make for Diana, I stumbled across a good-looking [recipe for ginger beer](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=371483).  I made a batch that turned out really well, and wanted to see if I could make a dry, alcoholic version.  After a bit of searching, I found another recipe [here](http://www.thehomebrewforum.co.uk/showthread.php?t=3826).  I decided to give it a try, with a few slight modifications.

#### The Ingredients
  * 10.6 oz Ginger
  * 1.5 tsp Dry Ginger
  * 0.25 tsp Cream of Tartar
  * Zest/Juice 2 Lemons
  * Zest/Juice 2 Limes
  * 1 cup Dk Brn Sugar
  * 1 cup White Sugar
  * 1/2 Sachet Red Star Cuvee Yeast
  * 1 tsp yeast nutrient

#### The Process
  * Add ginger, lime juice/zest, lemon juice/zest, and dry ginger to a pot with ~9 cups water
  * Bring to a boil and cook for ~30 minutes until liquid is reduced
  * Add sugar and cream of tartar, stir until dissolved
  * Strain and cool to room temperature
  * Measure out 5.5c concentrate and pour into a pan
  * Dilute with cool tap water to 1 gallon total
  * Take OG measurement and add sugar as needed to reach 1.045
  * Pour into fermenter, add yeast nutrient and yeast

Note: This actually makes ~2qt concentrate, enough for a 1.5 gallon batch OR a 2qt batch of non-alcoholic ginger beer :).

#### Update: 9/15/2016
This thing is fermenting like crazy.

#### Update: 9/18/2016
Seems like fermentation may be completed already.  Will wait a few more days and take a hydrometer reading to confirm.

#### Update: 9/20/2016
Measured SG 0.996 - I'm going to call this done!

Some tasting notes:
Nose has hints of ginger, citrus, and some yeasty flavors.  After cooling, I also pick up a little bit of banana, so there may be some diacetyl flavors in there.
Taste is strongly sour - like, more sour than I was hoping.  It's really super dry, and although there is a little bit of ginger flavor, it's less than I was hoping for.  There is still a bit of a ginger "bite" in the finish, though.

#### Update: 9/24/2016
Went ahead and bottled this beastie with ~26g of dark brown sugar for priming.  I'm hoping the brown sugar will leave a little residual flavor.

#### Update: 10/1/2016
The brown sugar didn't leave much in the way of residual flavor. The taste is pretty decent overall, but I'd change a few things next time.  First, I'd cut back on the sour elements (lemon, lime), as the final product is pretty sour.  Second, I'd add some extra ginger, leave it in the fermenter for primary, and then add some additional ginger in secondary to kick up the ginger flavor a bit.  I do think that the molasses flavor would go nice with the ginger, so I'd also consider swapping out the turbinado/brown sugar combination in the boil with panilla.

When I bottled this, it was still pretty cloudy, and I thought it would stay that way.  However, it cleared up alost completely in the bottle, leaving a pretty large pile of junk in the bottle.  I'd also let this sit for a while longer in the fermenter to allow it to clear.  Might need finings to get all the fine bits out.

One final thought - i think I targeted about 2.5 volumes of CO2 on this.  It seemed a little flat for my taste; I would probably aim for somewhere closer to 3 volumes next time.
