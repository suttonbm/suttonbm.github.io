Target is an off-dry mead, with three different varieties being evaluated:
  1. Cranberry Honey
  2. Blueberry Honey
  3. Raspberry Honey

#### Ingredients
4.1lb Honey
Top-up Water
Lalvin 71B-1112 (1/2 packet)
1/4tsp KHCO3

Target OG: 1.120
SNA Addition: 1.3g F-O at 24, 48, 72, 96hr
Aerate before each SNA addition

Fermentation Temp:
Start @ 15C, raise 2C/day when adding SNAs.

#### 8/1/17
Racked to glass carboy, with excess reserved in a mason jar.  Added 3 cubes american, 2 cubes french oak.  Plan to keep in for ~3 weeks, then rack again.

#### 8/4/17
Two of the honeys have some suspicious crap on top.  The bubbles are seeming to stay a while.  Worried I ended up with an infection.  Added a campden tablet to each of the carboys with suspicous stuff, just in case it's bacterial.  If it's a film yeast or something, I'm out of luck.  Other possibility is that there's some wax or protein in the mead which is congealing on the surface.
