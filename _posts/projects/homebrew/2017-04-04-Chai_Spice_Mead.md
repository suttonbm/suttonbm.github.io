Recipe found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/2zqolk/my_chai_mead_won_a_first_place_at_the_kona/cplpdvt/).

#### Ingredients:
1 Gallon Batch
2.9 lb Clover Honey
Top-Up Water to 1 Gal
1/4 tsp KHCO3
D47 Yeast, Rehydrated w/ Go-Ferm
4 packets Tazo Chai

Note - no water in airlock for the first three days.  Aerated/degassed after each SNA.

(Will add ~0.1 to 0.2lb Honey during/after fermentation)

Target OG = 1.114
Target FG = 1.010

SNA Schedule:
Target PPM per Addition = 43.8
@ 24hr: 0.60g F-O; 0.60g F-K
@ 48hr: 0.65g F-K; 0.40g DAP
@ 72hr: 0.65g F-K; 0.40g DAP
@ 92hr: 1.10g F-O

#### Plan:
Boiled method.  Bring 3qt water to a boil.  Kill heat, cut 4 tea bags into water.  Add honey.  Once cool, transfer to fermenter and top up with ice cold spring water.

Will let sit in primary for a couple months, rack, wait some more, then backsweeten with ~0.3lb honey.

#### 4/30/17
Added 0.2lb OB honey to primary.
