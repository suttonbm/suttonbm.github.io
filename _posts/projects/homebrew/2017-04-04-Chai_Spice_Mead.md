Recipe found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/2zqolk/my_chai_mead_won_a_first_place_at_the_kona/cplpdvt/).

#### Ingredients:
1 Gallon Batch
2.9 lb Clover Honey
Top-Up Water to 1 Gal
1/4 tsp KHCO3
D47 Yeast, Rehydrated w/ Go-Ferm
4 packets Tazo Chai

Note - no water in airlock for the first three days.  Aerated/degassed after each SNA.

(Will add ~0.1 to 0.2lb Honey during/after fermentation)

Target OG = 1.114
Target FG = 1.010

SNA Schedule:
Target PPM per Addition = 43.8
@ 24hr: 0.60g F-O; 0.60g F-K
@ 48hr: 0.65g F-K; 0.40g DAP
@ 72hr: 0.65g F-K; 0.40g DAP
@ 92hr: 1.10g F-O

#### Plan:
Boiled method.  Bring 3qt water to a boil.  Kill heat, cut 4 tea bags into water.  Add honey.  Once cool, transfer to fermenter and top up with ice cold spring water.

Will let sit in primary for a couple months, rack, wait some more, then backsweeten with ~0.3lb honey.

#### 4/30/17
Added 0.2lb OB honey to primary.

#### 6/16/17
Pulled a sample from primary to taste.

Appearance: Clear, and light golden in color.
Nose: Clover honey right off the nose.  Floral, with a hint of spices in the background.
Flavor: Definite alcohol.  Slightly tart.  Don't get too much honey character or spice.
Mouthfeel: Full body.  Definitely dry, and has some tannin to it.

Overall, not super impressed.  Probably need to consider sweetening it to help the spices "pop".  Could also use a bit more age, I suppose.  It has only been two months.

#### 7/6/17
Was still a bit disappointed with the aroma (no chai!) so I decided to amp it up.  I had planned to do another chai mead, except a bochet, and made some chai extract for that.  Decided to add it to this to kick the flavor up a notch.  Racked onto about 300mL. Details for that below.

#### Chai Tea Extract:
6 Green Cardamom Pods, Cracked
2.5 Cinnamon Sticks
4 White Peppercorns
5 Cloves
2 Tbsp Dried Ginger Slices
1 Star Anise
1 Allspice Berry
2 tsp Assam Tea
8 oz. Vodka

Steep spices and tea in the vodka for 2-3 weeks, until it punches you in the face when you open the jar.  Strain out the spices and dilute with 4oz water.
