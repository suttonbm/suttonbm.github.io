  Blueberry Wine, First Try
---

Adapted from Jack Keller's recipe [here](http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/request227.asp)

#### Ingredients
4lb Blueberries, Frozen and Thawed (Costco)
11 fl.oz Red Grape Concentrate
2.7 lb Wildflower Honey
1/2 t Pectic Enzyme
2.5 qt water
Lalvin RC-212

Target OG: 1.115

Actual OG: 1.116

#### Process (Plan)
Put frozen blueberries in a mesh bag, in a sanitized bucket.  Allow to sit 24hr to thaw.  Squeeze berries to press and pour boiling water over berries.  Once room temperature, add campden tablet dissolved in a little water.  Wait 24 hr, add pectic enzyme, and stir.  Allow to steep for three days.  Remove the nylon bag and squeeze to press out all the juice, then discard remaining seeds and pulp.  Dissolve honey with half the must in the primary bucket.  Add remaining must, pitch active yeast starter, and top up to 1.25 gallons.  Aerate daily for 4 days when adding nutrients. Pour into secondary fermenter, saving excess in 1qt canning jar with airlock.  Allow to sit for ~3 months, then rack again and top up with reserved must.  Bottle once clear and age for 6-12 months.

#### Starter Plan
Target 1/10 volume starter, mostly to pitch actively fermenting yeast in order to overcome benzoic acid in the blueberries.  Required starter volume is 470ml, and target gravity is 1.040.

  * Sterilize starter flask, and add 400ml water
  * Add 2.25oz clover honey
  * Pitch yeast rehydrated in go-ferm
  * Place on stir plate for ~1 day, or until active

#### SNA Plan
**Target Per Addition:** 35ppm
| | **Fermaid O** | **Fermaid K** | **DAP** | **Total** |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| First Addition 24h | 1.0g | 0.25g | 0.0g | 34.8ppm |
| Second Addition 48h | 0.0g | 1.06g | 0.31g | 36.3ppm |
| Third Addition 72h | 0.0g | 1.06g | 0.31g | 36.3ppm |
| Final Addition 96h | 1.13g | 0.0g | 0.0g | 33.4ppm |

#### Day 4:
Sealed up in the bucket after adding fourth nutrient addition.  I've been fermenting at ambient temperature given the ideal range for this yeast (20-30C).  My AC tops out at 77-78F during the day (25C).

#### 7/6/17
Racked to secondary with one campden tablet.  Reserved excess in a mason jar.  Added 6 medium+ char french oak cubes and 4 medium char american oak cubes.  Should age for ~6 months before I touch it.

#### 8/1/17
Topped up with some of the reserved wine.
