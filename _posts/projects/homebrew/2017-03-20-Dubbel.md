### Ingredients

0.2 40L
0.2 Special B
3lb Gold LME
0.5lb Gold Light DME
0.5lb Dark Candi
1oz Hersbrucker
Abbaye

### Plan:
Start @ 2.5gal H2O in kettle
  * Steep specialty grains while heating, rest @160F for 20min
  * Remove 0.5gal to separate pot for boil - dissolve candi sugar
  * Kill heat, add Gold LME + DME
  * Return to boil
  * 0.5oz Hersbrucker @ 60min
  * Dark Candi @ 20min (add back 1/2 gal)
  * 0.5oz Hersbrucker @ 10min
  * Cool wort
  * Rack wort to primary
  * Top up to 2.5gal + 8oz with spring water
  * Aerate vigorously to mix
  * Measure SG and Brix w/ refractometer
  * Pitch 1pk Abbaye dry
  * Start Ferment @ 65-68F, slowly raise to ~75F over 7 days

Target OG 1.062
Actual OG 1.062/14.6 Brix

Steeping Grains:
160.5 @ 10min
158.7 @ 20min

Pitched 1 pkt Lallemand Abbaye @ 76*.  Plan to hold ~67F until fermentation starts, then wrap and allow to rise.
Airlock got sucked into the fermenter overnight. Lucking it's star-san; hopefully I don't have issues.

#### Fermentation Plan:
Primary 4wk
Secondary 1-2mo

#### Bottling Plan:
Target carb 2.7vol

#### 4/3/17: Racked to Secondary

#### 5/9/17: Bottled @ 2.7 Vol
