  Burnin' the honey.
---

I've decided to try brewing a bochet - a mead brewed with caramelized honey.  Might take quite a while to age.

#### Ingredients:
1 Gallon Batch
3.07 lb Clover Honey
Top-Up Water to 1 Gal
1/4 tsp KHCO3
D47 Yeast, Rehydrated w/ Go-Ferm

Note - no water in the airlock for first three days.  Aerated/degassed after each SNA.

(Will add 0.25lb honey during/after fermentation)

Target OG = 1.114
Target FG = 1.010

SNA Schedule:
Target PPM per Addition = 43.8
@ 24hr: 0.55g F-O; 0.8g F-K
@ 48hr: 0.55g F-K; 0.56g DAP
@ 72hr: 0.55g F-K; 0.56g DAP
@ 92hr: 1.15g F-O

#### Plan:
Carmelize 3lb clover honey until aroma of toasted marshmallow.  Add hot water until it no longer splatters.  Top up with ice cold spring water to 1 gal.  When cool enough, pour into sanitized fermentation vessel and aerate.  Rehydrate yeast and pitch.  Will probably bulk age for quite a while to let flavors mellow.

Added 0.25lb Buckwheat honey to primary.

#### 6/16/17
Pulled a sample to taste.

Appearance: Clear, dark golden in color.
Nose: Sweet. Raisin or prune notes. Slight molasses coming through.
Flavor: Quite sweet.  Some clover honey comes through.  No bitterness.  A bit of fusel in there maybe, mixed with something almost medicinal.  Some raisin or prune flavor mixed in there as well.  Finish is pretty long, with some borderline toastiness.
Mouthfeel: Pretty full.  Leaves a coating feel in the mouth with lingering sweetnes.

Overall, not bad, but could probably use a bit more age.  I think I probably could have gone a bit darker with the caramelization as well.  I would have liked a bit more toastiness to it.  Perhaps some heavy char oak would help...

#### 7/6/17
Slight change of plan.  I noticed that this was starting to develop some tropical fruit notes - likely from resting on the lees of D47 for three months.  I noticed that the flavors seemed to complement Hye Silver Rum...  So I racked onto ~350mL of that.  Flavor is pretty awesome now.  Hoping it will continue to improve with age.
