  Trying an apples-to-apples comparison of honey varieties and yeast selection
---

The goal of this brew (really, these brews) was to explore flavor differences between two different yeasts and two different honey varieties.  I started four one-gallon batches as follows:

#### Batch No. 1
2.5lb Orange Blossom Honey
Ozarka Spring Water to 1 gal
1 packet Danstar K1V-1116 Yeast, rehydrated in Go-Ferm

SNA Schedule*
Target PPM/Addition = 46
24h - 0.5g F-O + 1.0g F-K
48h - 0.95g F-K + 0.38g DAP
72h - 0.9g DAP
96h - 1.24g F-O

Aerated once/day for first four days, immediately prior to SNA addition

_* Amended. See below for details._

#### Batch No. 2
2.5lb Orange Blossom Honey
Ozarka Spring Water to 1 gal
1/2 packet Lallemand Abbaye Yeast, Rehydrated in Go-Ferm**

SNA Schedule***
Target PPM/Addition = 68
24h - 0.63g F-O + 1.5g F-K
72h - 1.9g DAP
96h - 0.63g F-K + 0.97g DAP

Aerated once/day for first three days, immediately prior to SNA addition

_** Also, 1/2 packet dry Lallemand CBC-1. See below._
_*** Amended. See below._

#### Batch No. 3
Same as Batch No. 1, but with Wildflower Honey

#### Batch No. 4
Same as Batch No. 2, but with Wildflower Honey

### Brewing Notes
Unfortunately, despite planning this experiment out pretty carefully, things went wrong pretty quickly. First, despite writing out a detailed SNA plan for each batch, I goofed up and added the wrong thing.  Fortunately, I caught this, and adjusted later additions accordingly.  Originally the plan was to add F-O as the entire final addition, with any remainder added during the first addition.  Any remaining nutrient at the first addition was to be F-K.  Additions 2 and 3 were meant to be equal distributions of F-K and DAP.  I think I ended up adding too much F-O upfront (I don't recall the exact goof-up).  At any rate, the amended addition schedule is reflected above.

The next place I goofed up was on the yeast.  I'm not 100% sure I goofed up, but I do think I was impatient.  Despite rehydration in GoFerm per the recommended schedule, the Abbaye yeast showed an extremely sluggish start.  After 36 hours, there were no signs of active fermentation.  After getting concerned, I made an executive decision to add a half-packet of Lallemand CBC-1, dry, to both of the Abbaye batches.  After some research, I found that others have had lag times up to 72 hours without negative outcomes, so perhaps I should have continued to wait.  Regardless, fermentation picked up within about 8 hours of adding the CBC-1.  Due to the long lag time, I delayed the second SNA by 24 hours to compensate.  The first addition went in at 24 hours, before lag finished up.  The K1V had a lag time of ~8 hours.

Final challenge with these batches - I started the batches strategically in order to ensure I would be around for the SNA and aeration schedule prior to leaving town for the weekend.  However, due to the delayed SNA schedule that was a result of the long-lagging Abbaye, I ended up missing the final addition.  I feel that not all hope is lost - I made the assumption that Abbaye was a medium-high YAN requiring yeast, but there's no real data out there on whether this is the case.  In addition, because of the larger inoculation rate due to addition of CBC-1, there may have been less growth required, translating to lower YAN requirements.

#### 12/19/2016
Racked to secondary, added 2x French Medium, 2x American Medium, 1/2 Vanilla Bean to each.

#### 1/28/2017
Racked off vanilla, oak cubes to clear.  Added 1 campden tablet to each.

#### 2/11/2017: Initial Tasting
K1V OB:
  * Nose - Distinct white wine type scent.  Grapes.  Slight vanilla.
  * Taste - Tart. somewhat slick mouthfeel.  Slight alcohol.  Slight vanilla.

K1V WF:
  * Nose - White wine, but with some slight honey scent.  Slightly medicinal.  Barely notes of vanilla.  Slightly earthy.
  * Taste - Tart. Definite alcohol presence.  Slight flavor of white rice.  Dry mouthfeel.

Abbaye OB:
  * Nose - Slight white wine.  More honey than K1V.  Vanilla.  Little bit of citrus?
  * Taste - Alcohol. Honey. Smokey? A little funky. Coating mouthfeel.
  * The smokey-ish flavor suggests to me that this might go well with some hops.  Perhaps 1/2 gallon for dry hopping?

Abbaye WF:
  * Nose - Funk.  Slightly rubbery.  Vanilla.  Medicinal.
  * Taste - Medicinal. Alcohol. Floral.
  * Thoughts - Might be an interesting candidate for some experimental flavoring.  I'm thinking maybe rack 1/2 gallon onto some hibiscus flowers and allspice?

#### 2/12/2017: Mad Science
Adding to Abbaye WF:
  * 1/2tsp Allspice Berries
  * 0.5oz Hibiscus Flowers
  * 2oz Buckwheat Honey

Boiled Allspice & Hibiscus for 2-3 min to sanitize, added honey, allowed to cool before addition to fermenter.

Adding to Abbaye OB:
  * 0.2oz Cascade Hops
  * 1.75oz OB Honey

Heated 1/3c water to top up along w/ honey.

#### 2/28/2017
Racked off hops and hibiscus for the mad science experiments.

#### 3/9/2017
Bottled Hibiscus, Hops, and K1V OB.  Still deciding what to do with K1V WF.

#### 3/10/2017 Tasting notes for hopped mead:
Floral, grapey nose.  Not much hop detected.
Flavor has some alcohol feel to it.  Nice honey flavor with a bit of white wine feel to it.  Sweet, but not unpleasant.  Strong vanilla aftertaste.  Slight bitterness.

I'm fascinated that the hop flavor doesn't seem to be there.  Either that, or it blends really well with the honey flavor in this.  Looking forward to see how this develops with time.

#### 3/10/2017 Tasting notes for hibiscus mead:
It's a little weird.  Tastes somewhat medicinal, almost.  The spices seem to clash with the vanilla/honey flavor, and make it seem a bit boozey to me.  Also pretty light on the hibiscus flavors; may not have added enough or left them in the mead for long enough.  Will have to see what it tastes like after some aging time.

#### 3/22/2017
I think I'm going to make the K1V WF into a mixed berry melomel.  Rough game plan: add 1.5lb mixed berries to a bucket (inside a sanitized hop bag), rack mead onto berries, let sit for ~2 weeks.  Rack back into glass jar to allow flavors to meld.

#### 4/4/2017
Actual: 1.512lb Frozen Berries.  Didn't really let them thaw out all the way; I just racked the mead on.  I also added one campden tablet.

#### 4/30/17
Racked off the berries.  Seems to have gone dry.  Mead has a fantastic berry nose, and is a beautiful shade of red.  Flavor is quite nice, but a bit dry and acidic.  Will most likely backsweeten a bit.  Stabilized with 1/2t K-sorbate.  Will wait a few days and backsweeten.  Need to decide how to sweeten - honey, juice, or concentrate.  Or sugar.

#### 6/14/17
Adjusted acid, sweetness, and tannin to taste.  First time making flavor adjustments, so it was a bit adhoc.  However, I think the process was pretty decent.  I took three small cups and filled them with a known quantity of water, then added a known quantity of tannin, acid blend, and honey.  I had to re-measure the honey to compensate for volume change.  I then drew a small 90mL sample from the carboy and gradually added 2-3mL of each adjustment at a time until I was satisfied with the flavor.  I then adjusted up to the total volume, heated some water to just off a boil (to sanitize) then added to the carboy.

Final adjustments were:
Wine Tannin 0.53g
Acid Blend 0.71g
Clover Honey 3.8oz (by wt)

I'll let it sit in the fermenter for a few days to ensure it is not bubbling, then bottle.

#### 6/16/17
It's bubbling again...?

#### 8/1/17
Yeah, I screwed up.  Added the stuff above to the crackberry clone, not this.  Accidentally bottled this without any adjustment.  Flavor is OK, but overall the balance is horrible.  Super low acidity and tannins - almost tastes like cough syrup.  Bummer...
