  My First Homebrew
---

So, I decided to try brewing beer.  I'm not really 100% sure why I decided to.  It might be partially inspiration due to a good friend who is start up a distillery, or it might be some nostalgia for helping my dad with bottling a couple homebrews he produced when I was growing up.  Whatever the reason, I'm doing it.  I don't really drink that often, so I'm going to start out with one-gallon recipe kits.  I figure that a gallon translates to 8-12 bottles of finished product - enough to share with buddies at a couple of board game nights, but not so much that I'll be drinking the same stuff for months.  Also, less to dump in the sink if it turns out I suck at making beer.

Anyways, I had originally planned to start out with a [Brewers' Best Belgian Saison](http://www.austinhomebrew.com/Brewers-Best-Belgian-Saison--1-gallon_p_553.html) recipe, but Austin Homebrew oopsed and sent me the [Belgian Tripel](http://www.austinhomebrew.com/Brewers-Best-Belgian-Tripel--1-gallon_p_554.html).  I'm not exactly anticipating a super kick-ass beer to come out of my first attempt, so I'm not terribly disappointed about the mix-up.  Again - a nice thing about brewing a one-gallon batch.  That being said, I'm a little concerned about getting hydrometer measurements.  I hadn't planned on bothering with those - I figure, just wait until the carboy stops bubbling, wait a few more days, then stick the beer in bottles and let them get fizzy.  However, after doing some admittedly limited research into this Tripel recipe over at the [homebrew talk forums](http://www.homebrewtalk.com), I found out that this particular recipe kit is susceptible to stalled fermentation.  Seems like a lot of people have had the beer get stuck at a gravity of 1.020, while the expected final gravity is 1.009-1.018.  The risk is a beer that is too sweet and potentially bottle bombs...  Some people have had some success with pitching some Wyeast 3711 to get the gravity down further, so I'll have to keep that in mind.

At any rate, and without further ado,

### Brew Day!
The belgian tripel recipe that I've taken on isn't a pure malt recipe; the procedure calls for steeping some crushed, malted grains prior to adding the malt extract to the boil.  The full ingredients list follows:

  * 1 lb. 4oz. Pilsen Light DME
  * 10 oz. Candi Sugar
  * 2 oz. Malted Grain (unk. type)
  * 5g Brewer's Gold Hops
  * 3g Galena Hops
  * Safbrew S-33 Yeast

Note that this particular kit is not a pure extract; the first step is steeping the malted grain.

The procedure I used for the brew was as follows:

#### Brew Day AM

  1. Review list of equipment, stock up where needed
  2. Create checklist and brew day schedule
  3. Clean all dirty items with OxyClean Free (the carboy)
  4. Clean the entire kitchen (get the counters and stove ready to go :) )

#### Brew Day PM

Sanitize Everything (using StarSan)!

  * Airlock and Stopper
  * Funnel
  * Thermometer
  * Stirring Paddle
  * Primary Fermenter (2.5gal Glass Carboy)
  * Measuring Cup
  * Small Stainless Spoon

Prepare for Brew:

  * Ensure a spray bottle is filled with StarSan and close at hand
  * Double-check there is sufficient ice for cooling the wort
  * Set out all brewing ingredients
  * Boil ~1/2c water in the measuring cup
    * Cover with saran wrap to ensure no contamination

Start the Brew!

First I'm going to outline the "target" process recommended in the recipe kit instructions, then I'll list what I actually did.

#### Recipe Instructions

  1. Put 1.5gal water into brew pot
  2. Heat water until between 150 and 160F
  3. Place grain bag into brew pot and maintain temp for 20 min
  4. Remove grain bag and bring to boil
  5. Add DME
  6. Bring to boil, add Brewer's Gold Hops
  7. Boil 30 min
  8. Add Galena Hops
  9. Boil 20 min
  10. Add Candi Sugar
  11. Boil 10 min
  12. Cool the wort to below 70F
  13. Transfer to primary fermenter
  14. Pitch yeast (DRY)

#### Actual Process

  1. Put 1.5gal water into pot
  2. Heat water to 150F
  3. Place grain bag into brew pot
    * Temp Readings:
      * 0 min: 155F
      * 5 min: 160F
      * 10 min: 166F
      * 15 min: 166F
      * 20 min: 168F
  4. Remove grain bag, bring to boil
  5. Add DME
  6. Furiously avoid boil-over due to ridiculous foaming
  7. Add Brewer's Gold Hops
  8. Boil 30 min
  9. Add Galena Hops
  10. Boil 20 min
  11. Add Candi Sugar
  12. Boil 10 min
    * While boiling, prepare ice bath
    * Sanitize brew pot lid
  13. Cool wort
    * Cooled wort to ~66F in 18 min
    * Didn't cover the pot (maybe should have), stirred to accelerate cooling
  14. Set covered pot aside to prepare yeast
  15. Add yeast to 1/2c boiled water (now at room temp)
  16. Stir yeast with sanitized spoon, pour in fermenter
  17. Pour wort on yeast in primary fermenter
  18. Cap with airlock

#### Process Comments

A couple areas where I think there's some opportunity for improvement:

  1. I didn't cover the pot while cooling the wort.  I was pretty careful, and prioritized getting it cooled faster to ensure a nice cold break.  However, in doing so, I increased the risk of contaminating the beer.  Keeping it covered would have prevented this risk.
  2. I didn't really rehydrate the yeast properly.  I've read a lot of debate online about whether rehydration is REALLY required for dry yeast.  It seemy like the argument boils down to whether you are certain you've pitched a sufficient amount of yeast to get a good fermentation.  If you pitch the dry yeast, many cells die, and you lose viability.  However, with dry yeast, there are also a ton more cells.  Who knows.  In any case, however, I didn't allow the yeast to sit long enough in the water to really rehydrate - I just pitched them right into the fermenter.  Not sure what the impact of that will be, but I probably should have either (A) pitched the yeast dry, or (B) properly rehydrated the yeast with a 15min soak in the water.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with how my first brew turned out.  I didn't feel like I was scrambling around too much, and I didn't end up making any huge mistakes.  I did struggle a bit to find a good setting on the stove to keep the wort boiling a proper amount.  I spent a lot of time oscillating between heavy boils and just barely boils.  I couldn't get to a steady, gentle rolling boil.

Another area I've discovered I need to make some serious adjustments to the plan is fermentation process.  The instructions seem to be woefully insufficient in this area based on feedback from a lot of people on both [Beer Advocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/community/threads/belgian-tripel-questions.185490/) and [Homebrew Talk](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=349293).

### Fermentation Plan
The fermentation plan suggested by Brewer's Best is as follows:

  * Allow to ferment in the primary until the fermentation slows (4-6 days)
  * Before fermentation completes (I believe they mean bubbling...), rack to secondary
  * Leave beer in secondary for two weeks prior to bottling

However, as I mentioned a little earlier in the post, it seems like a lot of people struggle to get the specific gravity down into the range this beer is intended to be consumed at.  While there were a broad range of recommendations made on the forums about how best to ferment this beer, I'm going to take the following approach:

  * Allow to ferment in the primary for ~3 weeks
  * Rack to secondary and let rest for another ~3 weeks
  * Allow beer to bottle age for >4 weeks prior to consumption

Again, I am not planning on using a hydrometer to measure the specific gravity, and as a result, I'll be risking that the beer is too sweet.  However, because I'm doing a one-gallon batch, I'd lose a lot of liquid to take a measurement.  Plus, I don't have all the equipment and I'd rather spend my money on other things right now :).  It sounds like belgian tripels and other high-alcohol brews can take a long time to reach peak flavor, so I'll have to set aside a few bottles for tasting over time.

Anyways, that's all for now on this brew, will be back with updates after racking to secondary, bottling, and tasting sessions.

### Update - 9/6/2016
Well, I finally broke down and got a hydrometer.  I read enough stories about bottle bombs resulting from incomplete fermentation, and enough stories about incomplete fermentation with this recipe, that I had to do it.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about, though.  SG turned out ~1.013, right around the targeted final gravity.  I'll check again in another few days to make sure it's not moving, but it looks like I'm ready for bottling.

The best part about pulling the hydrometer sample?  Tasting notes!

#### Hydrometer Sample Tasting

The sample was really quite interesting.  Granted, it was nearly room temp and not carbonated, but still... interesting.  The nose was pretty fruity - almost like a cider.  However, the flavor was entirely different.  The flavor is somewhat bitter on the tip of the tongue, followed by a nice malty, slightly fruity taste.  The finish is also slightly bitter and pretty dry.  There is also a fairly strong alcohol flavor, but it blends well with the rest of the flavors - not overpowering.

I'll be really curious how this beer tastes in a few months after it is carbonated and conditioned in the bottle.
