Adapted from a recipe I found [on HBT](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=537030)

#### Recipe Details
Batch Size: 1 Gallon
Target OG: 1.100
Target FG: 1.000
Yeast: D47

#### Ingredients
3lb Caramelized Honey (Crockpot Method)
1/4tsp KHCO3
2 Tbsp Coffee, Coarsely Ground
4" Whole Cinnamon

#### Process
Cook the honey using the crockpot method until black and aromatic.  One qt cold water to dissolve honey.  Allow to cool to room temp and top up to one gallon with additional water.  Pitch yeast rehydrated in Go-Ferm.  Leave airlock empty for the first four days, and aerate daily when adding nutrients.  Leave in primary for 3-4 weeks.

Rack into secondary onto spices and 1 campden tablet.

#### Nutrient Schedule
**Target Per Addition:** 37ppm
| | **Fermaid O** | **Fermaid K** | **DAP** | **Total** |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| First Addition 36h | 0.90g | 0.25g | 0.0g | 39.9ppm |
| Second Addition 72h | 0.0g | 0.82g | 0.32g | 39.2ppm |
| Third Addition 72h | 0.0g | 0.82g | 0.32g | 39.2ppm |

#### Comments
Goofed up and forgot to add the final nutrient addition.  Sealed the fermenter after ~108hr, then fermented out at 19C.
