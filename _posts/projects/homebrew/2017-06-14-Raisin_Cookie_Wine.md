#### Ingredients
3.3lb Raisins (Assorted Dark, Golden, Zante)
0.5lb Wildflower Honey
1 gallon water
4oz flaked oats, toasted until brown
4" cinnamon
Lalvin K1V-1116 (2.5g)

Target OG: 1.100

#### Process
Place flaked oats in a grain bag and place in the water.  Raise to ~165F, remove heat, and steep for ~30 minutes.  Remove grain bag and squeeze.  Add raisins to the water and let soak for 20-30 minutes.  Strain out soaked raisins into a separate bowl.  About a cup at a time, add soaked raisins with some of the water and blend until smooth.  After all raisins have been blended, add to a bucket along with the honey and a campden tablet.  Allow to cool to room temperature and add pectic enzyme.  Let sit for 1-2 days then remove bag and squeeze dry.  Measure SG and top up to reach target OG.  Once RT, pitch yeast rehydrated with go-ferm.  Aerate daily for the first four days.  After four days, remove and squeeze the bag, discarding remaining fiber.  Pour into primary fermenter with airlock and leave it for ~3 weeks.  Rack to secondary on cinnamon and 1 campden tablet.  Optional vanilla bean?

#### Process Notes
Really couldn't squeeze out the bag with raisins.  Ended up dumping the whole thing into primary with the yeast.  Will let it go a few days and try the straining thing again when transferring to a glass carboy.

#### 6/20/17
Transferred to glass carboy.  I tried filtering the raisins out through a mesh bag, but it really didn't work well, so there are still raisins inside the fermenter.  Will have to hope they sink to the bottom so I can rack off of them eventually.

#### 6/27/17
Fermentation seems to have died down.  Hopefully I didn't oxidize it too bad by splash transferring.  Lots of sediment in the carboy.  May have to try cold crashing to see if the sediment compacts down any more.
