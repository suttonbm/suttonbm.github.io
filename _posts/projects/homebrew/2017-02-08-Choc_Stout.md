2/9:
Lag over, bubbling happily.  Temp ~60F, plan to keep low for ~4-5 days, then ramp up slowly to ~72F.

#### Fermentation Plan
Primary 3-4wk, Secondary 4-5wk (Total); add cacao nibs 2wk prior to bottling.

#### 2/28/17
Added 2oz Cacao nibs after soaking in Laphroaig Select (~2oz) for ~24 hours.  Dumped it all into primary.

So... here's the twist.  The recipe didn't call for this whole Laphroaig nonsense.  However, I was a bit concerned about contamination by just dumping the nibs directly into the fermentation vessel, and I didn't have any Vodka to work with.  Then, I got to thinking about these really awesome truffles I got a couple years back from Dude Sweet! chocolate, which were dark chocolate with Laphroaig mixed in.  For whatever reason, the peaty, smokey flavor of the scotch just went really well with the chocolate.  So I decided to try it in this beer.  I'll just have to wait and see how it turns out once it finishes carbing up :).

#### 3/8/17: Bottled
Target carb @ 2.2 vol

#### 5/3/17: Tasting
My first tasting of this was probably a month ago, and I was pretty disappointed.  There was some kind of metallic off-taste to my palate, and very little chocolate.  However, this latest tasting definitely makes me a bit  more hopeful.  Still a slight metallic scent to it, but with malt and chocolate tones.  The metallic flavor is definitely dissipating - I'm guessing that it may be contributed somehow by the Laphroaig, and it is slowly blending in.  I'm now getting pretty strong roasty-ness at the front of the taste, followed by some nice smokey-peaty flavor at the back.  The finish is fairly long, and slightly salty.  There is some smooth chocolate throughout, in the background.
