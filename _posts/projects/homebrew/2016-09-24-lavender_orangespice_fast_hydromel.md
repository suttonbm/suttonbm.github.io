After the somewhat disappointing result of my first mead attempt, I set out to find a recipe that will hopefully take less than a year to mellow out.  Bray Denard has posted a [short metheglin recipe](https://www.denardbrewing.com/blog/post/Fidnemed/) on his blog utilizing an herbal tea for enhancing flavor in a low-ABV mead.  Feeling inspired, I set out to create my own version with a couple different teas.  The first variant used pure lavender, and the second used Celestial Seasonings' Orange Spice tea.

The ingredients I used are the following:

#### Lavender Hydromel
  * ~1 quart H2O
  * 2.5 Heaping Tbsp Lavender Flowers
  * 1.5lb Costco Clover Honey
  * 1/2 tsp Yeast Energizer
  * 1 tsp Yeast Nutrient
  * 1/4 tsp Potassium Bicarbonate
  * 1/2 packet Lallemand CBC-1 Yeast

The lavender I used:

#### The Process
The process for starting these up was pretty straightforward

  * Bring 1qt water to a boil
  * Remove from heat, add tea ingredients
  * Steep until tepid, or about 45 min
  * Pour into 1 gallon carboy
  * Add honey
  * Top up to 1 gal with clean water
  * Add yeast nutrient & energizer
  * Shake like a crazy person to dissolve honey / aerate
  * Pitch yeast directly (dry) into must

Both batches appeared to ferment completely out in 4-5 days; left them a few more days at room temp to ensure they were done, then put in fridge ~9/30 to cold crash.

Bottle carbed to ~3 volumes CO2 - I want these suckers fizzy :).

#### Update: Tasting
First, the lavender.  After carbonation, the lavender flavor came out great.  The first few sips are super refreshing.  However, this drink is a one-trick pony.  After anything more than a few sips, the lavender flavor becomes too much, and I lose interest.  I'd be interested in trying this again, but perhaps with a weaker lavender tea brew and some sort of fruit to complement the flavor and add complexity.  Maybe strawberries in primary or secondary?  Will have to think more about that.

The orange spice is a bit better than the lavender, but is still lacking somewhat in complexity and body.  I feel that perhaps some maltodextrin or backsweetening to give it a slightly thicker mouthfeel would go a long way, and some orange zest in primary or secondary to add a bit more orange to the spice would complement the beverage really well.  One additional observation - something about this one makes the drink seem be higher ABV than it is.  After just one, I started feeling a little bit dizzy.  Not sure if it's one of the herbals in the tea or if I just botched the OG measurement.
