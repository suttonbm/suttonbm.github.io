Adapted from a recipe found at [HBT](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=68519)

#### Recipe Details
Batch Size: 1 Gallon
Target OG: 1.140
Target FG: 1.010
Yeast: K1V-1116

#### Ingredients
2 Cans Apple Juice Concetrate
0.6lb Crystal 60L
0.4lb Extra Light DME
2.25lb Clover Honey
1/4tsp KHCO3

Steep grains in ~1qt water at 165F for 20 minutes.  Add DME and bring to boil.  Boil for 10 min.  Add juice concentrate and then honey.  Water up to 1 gallon.  Pitch 1 packet K1V-1116 rehydrated in go-ferm.

SNA Schedule:
**Target Per Addition:** 29ppm
| | **Fermaid O** | **Fermaid K** | **DAP** | **Total** |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| First Addition 36h | 0.90g | 0.0g | 0.0g | 33.29ppm |
| Second Addition 72h | 0.00g | 1.00g | 0.00g | 27.00ppm |
| Third Addition 72h | 0.00g | 1.00g | 0.00g | 27.00ppm |

Nutrients were adjusted (approximately) to account for nutrients in the apple juice.  K1V is a strain with moderate YAN requirements; for this gravity must, it should take ~250mgN/L, but I adjusted that down to ~120mgN/L.  Who knows if that is accurate, but I'll find out if I end up with rocket fuel :).  Various sources suggest that melomels or cysers can have nutrient additions halved.

#### Comments
Goofed up and forgot to add the final nutrient addition.  Sealed the fermenter after ~108hr, then fermented out at 19C.

Secondary Additions:
1 Vanilla Bean
1 Cinnamon Stick

Split/scrape vanilla bean, break up cinammon stick, and add to 6oz neutral spirit.  Allow to sit for ~2-3 days before adding to secondary.

Let age for a few months and taste.  If it needs sweetening, stabilize and add up to 0.2lb additional honey.
