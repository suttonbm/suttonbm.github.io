By day, I'm a mild-mannered electrical/mechanical engineer; by night, a machine learning enthusiast and serial hobbyist.  I write this blog primarily for my own sake - it's a repository of various pieces of knowledge and also a historical record of things I've worked on or experienced over the years.

If you happen to stumble upon my page and want to get in touch, you can find me on LinkedIn, GitHub or Twitter using the links at the bottom of the page.

If not, have a nice life :).
